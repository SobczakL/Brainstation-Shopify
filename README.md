## Project Proposal Next Steps:
**Given more time and resources, we would complete the following:**
- Conduct usability testing with prototype to obtain practical real-time feedback, which would then be analyzed and incorporated into design improvements
- Expand to a mobile version our design solution to support the growing demand for mobile capabilities for merchants who are often on-the-go
- Measure our success through Data Science, using A/B Testing and Funnel Analysis, to determine if adding chatbots to the onboarding experience results in gaining and retaining more merchants, and thus increasing business and profits for Shopify
