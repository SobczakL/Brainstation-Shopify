I will continue to use this service.,I love using Shopify to sell my music and merchandise. This platform makes my store stand out with various design features and also allows me to give fans a unique experience while shopping.,The only thing about this software is that digital goods are hard to sell because of a lack of apps and features for these products. Especially music and music preview players and e-books.
Lead Designer in US,"Design, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify - Easy to use and looks great!,"Overall, Shopify has been a great experience. It does everything well, and even though the backend can sometimes get confusing, the front-end product it delivers to users is beautiful and efficient. I highly recommend Shopify if someone is thinking about launching an online store. It's simple if you need it to be, and complex if you need to expand to fulfill a large online e-commerce presence.","Shopify is very good at what it does. I like that Shopify can be streamlined and simple, or complex and robust. It's easy to have a store up and running within a few hours. However, if you want to do Shopify well, I recommend diving into its vast features and offerings. One of Shopify's best features is their analytics tracking. When logging in, Shopify gives an overview dashboard of what is happening in your store. You can see recent orders, sales trends, and even where you're slacking on order fulfillment. Additionally, Shopify provides stats on abandoned checkout cart conversion percentage compared to other stores, sales earnings compared to previous weeks, and even shows which users are live on the site at the moment you view it.","Shopify has many, many strong points. However, it does get tricky with its product categorization. The way to classify product tags and collections is not intuitive, and can definitely confuse new users. Additionally, Shopify makes order shipping label printing difficult when not paired with one of their partners (USPS, UPS, DHL)."
"CEO, Marketing and Public Relations Professional in US","Marketing & Advertising, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,DO NOT HESITATE TO USE SHOPIFY!!!,"My overall experience with Shopify is that I will not be deleting my Shopify website! I love the platform, love the themes, love the many ways you can customize the themes, and love the thought that SO many huge companies are actually using Shopify as well! Fashion Nova, Steve Madden, Staples, etc. all use Shopify for their websites! Amazing to know someone small can create a website like the big companies and become successful all on their own! It’s definitely worth the time to give a try!","I liked that Shopify’s platform is very easy to use, even for a web-developing beginner! You need absolutely no skills to build a Shopify store that will amaze your website visitors! Simply select a theme that fits well with your store’s niche and go from there. There are so many app add-ons that you can download to your Shopify store to make it POP. And the best part? You can utilize their free-trial to build your website with no restrictions so that possibly at the end of your trial (like me) you are already ready to launch your store with the $30/month subscription!","I definitely do not like that most app add-ons are additional fees. Once you realize there are other apps you want/need, the cost adds up to where you will find yourself needing nearly a $100/month budget (unless you select a higher costing Shopify subscription, that can run you up to nearly a $200/month budget). More free (not just free-trial) apps need to be available because not everyone can afford to keep paying monthly for everything, ESPECIALLY during this pandemic. A reduced monthly subscription fee during this pandemic would have been super considerate!"
Co-founder in Belgium,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,4.0,Moving from woocommerce to Shopify: the right direction,We managed to set up a new website from scratch in a matter of days by modifying a paid theme and adding a set of key plugins.,"Shopify is a simple solution to get you started fast, without the need to code. The rare coding I had to do was also quite simple, allowing me to create the website from scratch in a matter of days (as opposed to weeks before).
The visual approach of the many themes that you can simply buy, add and start adapting makes it a breeze. It is this community approach that makes it interesting as the web is filled with questions & answers, plugins and themes - both free and paying.
The multitude of plugins make it easy to connect payment methods, delivery solutions or add additional features in no time. Not each plugin is equally well integrated, but that's rather the plugin's issue, not Shopify's.
Comparing it with our previous webshop that we created in Woocommerce, it wins hands down.","The downside of its more simplistic approach (in which you do no longer need to code), is that you give up on flexibility. Tweaking a theme is cumbersome, yet not impossible. Coming from Woocommerce (in combination with Wordpress), we had to switch our mindset: from creating what we wanted, we needed to comply with what was offered. Luckily, we found a great theme that made it easy to make that switch.
For companies who require a very specific approach, it might take some more work, but it is definitely feasible.
Technically speaking, it sometimes works strange, even counter intuitive or it's even hit or miss (with regards to saving, language switching etc). Luckily, it is a rare thing.
The monthly fee could be a drawback for some, but when you see what you get, it is definitely worth the cost."

This is probably the most important aspect as it is the impression you make to a customer before they actually receive your product,Sometimes you desire more features and often you need a 3rd party add on to make it happens. Not all 3rd party add-ons are straight forward and so sometimes it can take some work to make things as you want them

Need a theme? There are hundreds of free and paid ones on themes.shopify.com. Multilingual features? Upsell features? All sorts of different marketing and client retention techniques?

Sometimes you edit product variations, save it, then seconds/minutes later it goes back to where it was. So you have to keep saving and updating the page depending on what you work. Plus, the Text/HTML editor is not so ""rich"" as it seems. Constantly having trouble. I recommend using a free alternative HTML editor online and then pasting the code there."
"Real Estate, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,Reviewer Source,5.0,Shopify Review,"As I would see it, Shopify is an astounding stage to develop with.

Incorporation Options.",The major con for Shopify is that the membership and exchange charges. Shopify plans start at $29 for essential plans and increment up to $299 for a few progressed plans. Different costs incorporate exchange charges related with selling on the web as well as membership expenses to utilize the applications you want.
Owner in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,"Shopify is vital for e-commerce, but be weary of upgrading to Plus.","Overall, it has been great. I just wish that the sliding scale for Plus hosting started at a more reasonable amount ... I mean, if they took away my MSM and increased my CC processing, they should have reflected that in my monthly hosting. Just started at $1499 vs $2K would show more good faith in wanting to grow WITH a brand vs taking whatever they can get. (Hence I have been debating whether or not to downgrade back to ""advanced"" for ages but I use Plus to do advanced Tax Calculations @ checkout, etc) I am also really upset that now Shopify Payments does NOT refund the processing fees on canceled transactions - so if I have a high value/suspect order that I don't feel comfortable shipping, I am still out +/- 3% for nothing. (for the first 5+ years, the CC processing was refunded on canceled orders)","I have run my business on shopify for nearly 8 years. I love how user-friendly the backend is and how even with VERY limited coding experience, I can update cosmetic issues seamlessly and easily by myself through the theme editor.","There are a lot of things that could be better. I feel like the constant response when you need to figure out how to do something is, ""oh, there's an app for that"" ... and apps cost money. With ShopifyPlus, already being $2,000 a month, it can be pretty hard to stomach SO many third party apps to get stuff done. Especially when most 3rd party apps can clutter your theme-file and cause unexpected issues on the front end. I also am personally super salty over the fact that I migrated to ShopifyPlus years ago, from Advanced, to save money on credit card processing fees. Plus, at the time, was $999 a year and I was promised that I would be able to keep that ""grandfathered"" rate moving forward. But it did not take long for them to a) take away my preferred credit card processing rate due to higher-than-usual ratio of international transactions and then they ALSO doubled my monthly hosting from $999 to $2,000. But once you upgrade, it can be very hard to go back down to ""Advanced"". They also took away my ""merchant success manager"" ... so I am spending $2K a month on ""Plus"" and also had most of the ""Plus"" perks taken away from me. I just feel like Shopify doesn't care much about their store owners who've been around for so long."
Small Business Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,JAM Shopify Review,"Well, around the beginning of the pandemic, I noticed many stores at physical locations closing. People were panicking with uncertainty of where to look next for their clothing, their shoes, anything else they may need. I got into retail to give consumers the reliable option the next time stores regardless of the reason ever closed down again, the solution of coming to an online store, knowing it is always open for them. With the current Recession, this may happen once again, and in doing so, this solution becomes more reliable, with delivery not being a problem, and Shopify software running smoothly, it makes sense for such solution provided. On the flip side, currently Savepace LLC has an issue that Shopify software does not have an answer for at this time as there are no financing options available on the software. Even if there were, Shopify would still have no answer for about 6 months. Overall, from billing to the order management, the site speed to no visual issues, its been a wonderful pleasant experience, and I expect it to continue as I seek to upgrade the software in the near future.","I like how I am able to run my retail business with a ton of support behind it, there is so much software ranging from Shopify's own to others I integrate that making building, growing the business less stressful. I really, really, like Shopify's accounting software that leaves people stunned! It allows me to keep better track of sales, fees, costs, and also allows me to project where finances may be within the next few months. I really like how the software updates without asking me to, updating in the background as I continue focusing on doing what I need to do with my store. The pricing of the software has always been reasonable, never too expensive, and never cheap, and, is based on my need. I really like how popular the software has become too, and the positive impacts it has worldwide such as saving small business owners a ton of money, choice of upgrading when ready, letting me know ahead of time when announcements about the software, and, anything else that maybe extremely important. As for integration, it depends on the app I choose, because while it may be easy to integrate onto the software, certain apps can be difficult to remove from the software once it has been integrated fully.","There is a passive-aggressive push for a Commerce plan to use on the software. Sure, for small businesses already on its mid approach that's appropriate as the developers should assist them as much as possible, but for many struggling business, the constant passive-aggressive push when logging onto the software can be a real pain, especially when focusing on order management. Regarding integration, certain apps require the software origination or for additional payments to process sort of like 3 months of back rent, even when it feels like its 3 months fronted rent before you can see that the integrated app has been removed. I advise Caution which apps users integrate overall. The design of it in the background could use a change. Its been three years. The software needs more style!! The security of it could use incorporation of VPN users, and currently the software does not have this."

If you give thousands of dollars, they'll let you. urls have to take prefixes like pages/ collections/. It's frustrating not being able to remove them. In order to do real customization, it is necessary to learn the liquid language. It is a bit difficult to develop on it, there is no test environment.

Some of the things that were mentioned by users include:Better integration with customer relationship management (CRM) systems for better contact and lead management.More advanced customization options for product pages to allow for better product presentation.Better integration with accounting software for more efficient financial management.Customization options for payment pages for a better user experience.And as many other users often mention, I find that some aspects of the platform can be difficult to use for non-technical users, such as advanced theme customization or setting up advanced shipping options. However, there are many resources online to help users understand these features and set them up"
Creative Director in UK,"Design, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The best for e-commerce,Impressive e-commerce facilities. The best choice to build an online store.,"Of the big 3 website builders (Shopify, Squarespace, Wix), Shopify is hands down the best for e-commerce. The other platforms simply don't have the same level of e-commerce support - from advanced shipping options to the wide range of discounts you can create for your online store. The extensive App Store also offers easy-to-install plugins to enhance your website's functionality. If you're serious about growing your online store, Shopify is the way to go.","It has to be said that Shopify is not as pretty as Squarespace or Wix, both of which being more design-led platforms. Shopify 2.0 was a major upgrade, in that you can now add design blocks to every page. But unless you know how to do custom coding, the design features are still somewhat limited. The email campaign feature is buggy - Wix is much better for that, but then Wix isn't really suited to run an online store."
Digital Marketing Sales Specialist in Spain,"Banking, 10,000+ Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,High cart flexibility and low cost,"You can later extend the required functions with third-party applications developed by others. There are numerous applications available, ranging from website functionality to marketing functionality. There are many paid features and many payment methods that can be used with no monthly fees and payment only. There are many design templates, from free to paid, and scalability is high.","There is a high degree of freedom in page configuration when creating an EC site. In addition to the look and feel of the design, you can customize it with a wide variety of applications, so even amateurs can complete an EC site that looks like it was created from scratch by a professional. You can also update your blog. With a wide range of payment methods, we can offer customers a seamless shopping experience. Above all, the costs and maintenance fees are cheaper than other cart API systems.","The initial status of the mail template is not ready for use as-is, and its customization is quite complicated. If two days have passed since the order was placed, the payment status of a convenience store, etc. will be shown as ""expired"" even before the payment deadline, which will complicate the order management."
Web Specialist in US,"Sporting Goods, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,3.0,Shopify is the Yahoo Stores for a New Generation,"We are only now setting up the store and getting into using the software so my opinion may change over time (although I doubt it will be for the better). Like Yahoo Stores before them they felt the need to write their own program language for the store instead of using tried and true coding that everyone knows or understands at this point. Making it difficult to change or adjust your store template easily. Also like Yahoo they take a percentage of your sales on top of the monthly fees. If someone needs a site for a few items, can use one of the free templates, doesn't want to use too many other features, and doesn't have a dedicated ecommerce manager then this may be a good solution for you. If you need to set up additional metafields or have better control over you SEO, you may want to look somewhere else. Expect multiple monthly subscriptions and fees above the Shopify fees as you will need to use other apps in your store.","Modern eCommerce selling features.
Hopefully better shopping experience for our customers than our old solution.","Monthly fees PLUS a per transaction fee.
Uses a custom script/language instead of standard coding. (Liquid).
Does not utilize WebDAV or FTP for file uploads.
Does not allow import/export of anything other than basic product information without use of a third party app.
Relies on 3rd party apps to offer features other carts offer out of the box.
Cannot customize the checkout process, must do what they say is best.
Poor SEO controls."

It is one big ecosystem that sometimes works in your favour but unfortunately very much works in theirs.,"Shopify does a good job of enabling you to start selling very quickly. You need to be aware that this only includes very limited functionality though and any extra options you may need to add, even as simple as a pre-sale or adding meta fields (custom fields) requires an monthly fee for an App. We currently have 5 Apps installed that almost cost the same as our subscription charge but I have been involved in some Shopify projects where the App to subscription charge was triple. You need to really consider what functionality you deem necessary before adding extra apps as this can all add up. Of course if the functionality is necessary and pays for itself with one order then it is all worth it.",The core functionality is a little limited. Shopify+ has the promise of almost unlimited functionality but the cost is prohibitive for most shops and even though they could give standard Shopify users access to some of these functions they don’t so most functionality does require an App
"Consumer Goods, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,Good ecommerce platform,My domain is hosted by a different company but I was able to easily link the shopify site to my domain using the DNS as shop.domain.uk,"The order and stock management system is really good. The platform allows you to create tags and searchable functions which in turn help your customers.
A variety of different payment methods can be added
Holiday mode can be activated where orders are not accepted and you pay a lower monthly fee.
Lots of great templates to use to create your site quickly. Great apps that you can integrate including things like newsletter sign up or customer loyalty schemes","Takes a little while to add all your products but worth it once done.
If you want to set up automatic postage costs you will need to know the weight of everything you have on your site."

Also for beginner D2C brands, it's a boom as one doesn't have to worry about building tech and hiring a team to maintain it or enhance it is also a fact that as your business grows using Shopify will become a pain because of the high charges of the platform which depends upon your Daily volume so it's great until your volume is low or medium.","Pros:-

Co-Founder in US,"Industrial Automation, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Great E-Commerce Software!,"Overall, I recommend this software for anyone looking for an e-commerce software with a lot of great features and functionality for a reasonable price. I have had very few issues with this software over the years, and I am overall satisfied with how well it has worked on our website.","We have been using this at my company for years and it has lots of features that make e-commerce very simple. This is how we facilitate and track sales on our website, and it’s always gone very smooth with this software.",Customer service could be a bit quicker to respond.
Store Owner in US,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,My Shopify experience,"I loved using the app. It was a bit challenging to build my store when I first started but I hired someone to make it professional and it honestly looked great! I loved seeing how the apps worked and brought my store to life to help upsell products, setting up the codes can be a bit difficult and also learning how to read the analytics of your store is a bit complex. I didn't make that many sales but I got tons of traffic to my store and that was helpful in reading conversions and seeing who almost bought something but didn't and seeing the locations around the world of who was viewing my product was really cool. I loved the app and it's features overall but I think having a Free membership program with a few more features from the basic plan instead of a trial program is better since it's generally hard to make a sale in a month let alone make one in 14 days.","I like the efficiency of the software. It's easy to use, simple to navigate, can take some time to understand the conversion rates and percentages of everything but overall pretty good app. I like the configuration and the training videos are helpful in some cases as well.",I definitely did not like how they charged for the apps to integrate into the store. It's a lot of hassle having to sign up for those apps just to get slammed with the monthly fees on top of the cost of the shopify store itself especially in the first few months when you're just starting out and you don't even make a sale. Those monthly fees got one of my stores closed.
"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,5.0,Shopify Customer Review,Shopify enabled us to expand our eBay operation and become fully independent. We are able to display our products and retain our identity online.,It is easy to use and learn. Errors can be rectified easily and cataloging is easy once you understand the basics of tagging. Themes offered are easy to use and modify. Customer service is available any time and phone reps are well spoken and fluent in english. Very good option is considering a move from eBay with their ever changing policies.,The software does take time to learn and there are limitations as it is not a tailored custom solution. But there are work around and almost any functionality can be added or achieved on shopify.

Low cost start-up, loads of products gaining popularity in the boom of online selling/buying. It really helps with clients complains or refunds, no worry of shopping, specifically no ware house needed, no inventory management requirements.
Strong customer support system 24/7 navigation (CTA) on point, that simply means one can email,phone& live chart without problem encountered. Shopify it's a best global retail operating system supplier for modernized development, and with all that said, it is an extreme tech savvy plus it's administrative panel is on point. Therein it's fair pricing amazing, and the fact that it has multiple payment choices giving costumers a variety of products that personally gives me peace of mind.
Shopify is super user-friendly it's strong SEO and marketing device (POS), it really makes it possible for a sale to badge in.","Shopify brings a high number of orders but interm of dropshiping stable, we all know protection is key regardlessly people of sudden expectation still find online a risky tool for running a lucrative business, have more additional invest on cyberpunk, system support (HTTPS)& (SSL) so customers can see conveniently infor safety requirements.

Business Owner & Attorney in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,I love using Shopify for my Ecommerce Shop!,"Overall, I love Shopify despite the minor improvements they could implement, and I believe it is definitely the best ecommerce platform out there especially for beginners!","What I love about Shopify is that it is incredibly user friendly, anyone can use it to start a business. I also like the app store a lot because there is an app for almost anything you need in order to run an ecommerce shop from finding products to setting up email marketing and Website Design. They have a number of free website templates that are easy to use and look great, and they offer a free two week trial for each store you open with them before you decide to stay with them or not!","Some of the apps from the app store can be pretty costly each month, although that is more down to the app designer than Shopify. I also wish there was a better way of categorizing products within the broader category option because I sell hundreds of products in my store. I have to resort to paying for an app to do this for me."
Sales in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,"Shopify, Great for Running Your Buisness",Shopify has overall been very wonderful for my business and myself. I am able to track manage ship all products to customers without a big hassle which is definitely providing me to give great customer service which can be very hard to manage for some businesses who who aren't able to complete these steps and their sales. I'm able to keep up with everything that is going on with my business and the revenue. So I definitely would recommend Shopify for anyone and everyone looking for a software capable of helping you manage and feel 100% confident your sales.,Features that are very impactful and that I like most about Shopify software is it is easy to understand and set up your business to run on. Customer support is also great which is key when choosing a software to help manage your work. It definitely is easy to work with and customers always satisfied with how simple the whole process ends up being.,Interrogation with my business process was not difficult. I do tend to understand and grasp technology and its navigation fairly easily but the software shopify provides is definitely a Top Choice in my opinion for anyone because they make it easy for many many businesses to understand and not feel confused about what you are doing. The only thing I do wish is that Shopify gave you more customisation options as two themes of the software changing colors or fonts with tons of options. This is only because I love to make all my sites pictures and apps colorful different unique.
Private in South Africa,"Government Relations, 1,001–5,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify Review - What to know,"Shopify is an easy-to-use platform. It has a clean, intuitive UI and gives a generally positive user experience, although there are a few of flaws with content layout and graphics that are worth focusing in on.","Shopify is the most user-friendly eCommerce platform, with a great balance of strength and simplicity.
Shopify's plugin and theme markets are incredible.
Shopify allows for true multi-currency selling, which is something that many competitor systems do not allow.
Shopify has a free email marketing tool that allows you to host and email up to 2,500 subscribers.
If you utilize Shopify Payments, the built-in payment processing system, there are no transaction costs.
Shopify supports a huge variety of external payment gateways.
Before committing to Shopify, you can sample it for free and without giving your credit card information.","Key feature that you might expect to be available out of the box frequently requires the installation of an app, which can make store setup a little more hard than you'd want or cause your site to slow down a little.
Shopify will set you back $30 per month or more, which may seem exorbitant when compared to some of the open source alternatives.
Professional reporting is only available on the more expensive subscriptions.
If you aren't using 'Shopify Shipping' to provide real-time carrier rates to your consumers, or if you live in a location where it isn't available, this functionality can be rather costly, or it may need you to purchase an annual subscription.
Some of the more interesting features are only available on the more expensive subscriptions."
Founder in Mexico,"Wholesale, 201–500 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Is this the right E-Commerce platform for your SMB?,"Easy to use platform, fast, and has a lot of documentation. Good customer support and extremely friendly to all levels of experience. But it comes at a not so insignificant price, specially at the early stages, and more customization will be expensive and require a significant investment and experience from a qualified developer.","Shopify is an out of the box ecommerce platform where you can be up and running in less than 10 minutes. But, is that good enough?. All that you need to create a good experience and nice looking e-commerce, can be very easy if you know what to do and are familiar with templates. Setting up everything including payment is EASY, fast, and everything happens in real time.","I don't see this as a ""cheap software"", specially if you come from a non european union / north america country. It has many layers of costs, first the upfront monthly fee, and also they take a small percentage out of your sales. It's an amazing business model for them, not so much for the small user. Also, nowadays, with so many people using shopify out there for their e-commerce, all stores look a like. It's hard to find a Shopify e-commerce store with a unique experience. And any additional change that you'd like to do that you can't do in the editor, you'll need an experienced developer."
Marketer in Mexico,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify is the best option for ecommerce,"Shopify helps me develop amazing stores, that work well in all devices and can easily integrate to more platforms needed within my sales system. I’m greatly pleased with the platform so far and excited to see which new features might come in the future.","Shopify it’s a platform built for ecommerce specifically, therefore all its features provide a better process for all the activities an ecomm needs to have, compared to different softwares that were built mainly as corporate websites and now include options to accept payments. It’s easy to use, comes with limitations in design as all templates are pre-approved by user design experts and it’s designed to deliver a great experience, so if you are looking for 100% customization you might need to reconsider the goals of your project. It’s also great to be able to add more apps / softwares that enable features that give you a more powerful platform for your business. And lastly, I believe their support team is great, as I always get fast response to my inquiries.",There are limitations in customization and you can’t enable multi-currency stores unless you are in one of the countries accepted.
Manager in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Honest and open review of Shopify,"My print-on-demand web store was powered by Shopify (which is not active anymore for commercial reasons, but I still keep my account there so I am still a paying customer). Technically, the system is simple to use, and the customer service is superb. Shopify provides you with a few design templates to begin with, which you may need some assistance customizing if you have a specific idea for the look of your future website. That was the most difficult element for me, as it always is when creating a good-looking website. If you opt with something easy, you'll be able to get your store up and operating in a matter of hours - no coding required. And that was i did mostly. I highly recommend Shopify if you are like me.","I like Shopify's robust backend editor and inventory system, which have helped me manage – and scale – larger stores. I also like Shopify's ability to sell via many channels, such as Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, and eBay. Its unique design functionality and versatility, allow me to choose from a variety of free and paid themes, as well as its extensive library of apps and third-party extensions, all of which help with taking my business to the next level. I like that it accepts over 100 different payment methods and has its own payment gateway, Shopify Payments. Their round-the-clock customer service is also excellent.","Its inventory has very modest functionality and limited sales channel compatibility, as well as US-only features like real-time delivery, which isn't available anywhere else in the world, to my knowledge. Its inability to support simultaneous discounts is also a flaw.
Shopify is also overly reliant on third-party apps, which makes my job more difficult because I have to familiarize myself with all of these addons and the necessity of using other third-party apps to truly enhance the functioning of your store. Shopify also has high transaction fees, which is fine while using Shopify Payments, but it adds up and becomes a significant cost, especially when combined with other payment gateway rates. As a result, it is more costly than it appears."
Office & Marketing Manager in US,"Mechanical or Industrial Engineering, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify beats all competition in the eCommerce world!,"Of all the eCommerce options available, Shopify is by far the most convenient service out there. It offers a wide variety of features and is compatible with most commonly used apps. It has a convenient user interface and is very easy to use! Highly recommended!","The best thing about Shopify is the ease of use over its competitors. The user interface is very straight forward and the templates they have available practically customize themselves. Shopify also offers a comprehensive knowledge base where you can get answers to just about anything you can possibly think of. If you’re looking for a headache then use one of the other options out there, but if you’re looking for a painless experience getting your online store up and running then Shopify is the service for you!","Shopify is compatible with a lot of 3rd party plug-ins and apps, but there are still a few they’re missing. For example, we had to switch our email client over to MailChimp because Shopify isn’t compatible with the ReachMail service we had been using… and it took a lot of time to switch everything over. I recommend you make sure all of your current services are compatible with Shopify before choosing them for your eCommerce site."
Business Owner in US,"Information Technology & Services, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,Shopify gets the job done!,"I was unable to make the full switch to shopify BUT I was impressed by what I saw. The overall design of the backend was much cleaner than expected. Sadly, I could not justify the switch as features I wanted cost more when compared to competitors, and the cost difference could not be justified. Its not a complete online e-commerce solution.","Nearly everything on their backend was well thought out and easy to use. I was able to have an online store configured in minutes from my already existing product catalog, and integration into my already existing product stack was easy to understand.",The ONE feature I need to be able to switch to literally ANYONE else was NOT a standard feature and would cost me additional fees. Without the ability to distribute keys/codes leaving my current provider serves no purpose as it would just increase my monthly operating costs. The feature set for all of these online e-commerce solutions is almost cookie cutter otherwise.
Sr. Account Manager in US,"Furniture, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Easy to use and reasonably priced software for selling online,"Overall, Shopify has delivered a great experience and made selling online quite easy. The platform is very well organized and seemingly provides online sellers with the technological infrastructure they need to succeed.","Shopify is very easy to use and has a number of great apps and plugins to choose from, many which can be implemented for free or for under $20 a month. Also, Shopify has a great program called Shopify Capital that makes it possible for online businesses to get the capital they need to expand their business. Additionally, the software makes it possible for online sellers to offer Buy now, Pay later to their customers which allows them to spread payments out over a certain period time. One last positive is that the software makes doing bulk changes relatively easy.","One area in which this software can be improved is making it possible for users to change things like UPC or GTIN codes without having to edit each variant. Also, sometimes adding certain apps and plugins can alter the proper functionality of certain software features."
Brand Director and Partner in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Great platform for small business ecommerce,"We're a small agency that used to focus primarily on Wordpress sites, but as clients came to us with sites built on other platforms, we've quickly come up-to-speed on Squarespace, Wix and Shopify as well. Hands-down, Shopify is a great platform for ecommerce, especially for companies that require the ease of having everything they need under one umbrella platform. It's easy to make the site look great, without requiring coding.","Shopify is easy to set up, modify and manage without requiring outside technical support. The interface is fresh and modern, loads fast, and everything you need in terms of additional software apps are within easy reach from the admin panel.","I really wish it were easier to create marketing campaign landing pages in Shopify. The platform isn't built for creating multiple unique page types. In fact, it's not intuitive at all when it comes to adding and editing a new page type. Luckily, there are landing page apps available that can help with that. App integration is a snap, and we like that apps are billed monthly... it makes it easy for us to audition a new app and see how well it works for us. There are many inexpensive and even free apps available."

CEO in Austria,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,"Shopify: A Viable Option, to quickly set up and manage an Online Store with ease.","For me, Shopify (+ Shopify Plus) is the platform par excellence to efficiently and successfully implement e-commerce projects. Even with limited resources, you can sell here on enterprise level without worries and grow later without any problems. Through the large Shopify universe, there is an enormous collective wealth of experience with top talent in the development and consulting of e-commerce projects of any size.","Shopify offers the possibility to implement ideas directly. Thanks to the modular system, stores can be set up literally within minutes.
The existing payment module can be set up, and apps can be installed for analysis, marketing, and aesthetics.
Especially for e-commerce newcomers without much background experience in web design, the foundation can be laid quickly and the noticeable progress in success motivates to continue. Anyone who wants to get from A to B quickly and loves Pareto will also love Shopify!","Due to the simple operation and the now widespread use of Shopify, you run the risk of developing a store 'like any other'. Structure and basic structures are always very similar and require code adaptations to stand out from the crowd.
Especially for newcomers, custom coding can be overwhelming, which often leads to the necessity of paid apps or the consultation of specialized web developers, as soon as something ""special is required""."

I have built several stores using this product and it is now down to a science where it takes less than a day to research, setup and run a store on Shopify.","If you are doing ecommerce, Shopify is it.

SEO Expert in Bangladesh,"Computer Software, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,The Most Easy to Use CMS for Building a Virtual Store,"As an owner of a digital marketing agency, I often need to build virtual stores for my clients. Normally most of the clients are the owners of small businesses and they can't afford to hire a professional developer for maintaining their e-commerce store. This is why I was looking for a platform that will help my clients maintain the site by themselves without going through a steep learning curve. Then I found Shopify and believe me, I think this is the ultimate destination. Day by day it's getting better and better. I know there are some other platforms with more flexibility but those are too complex to handle. Also, Shopify is completely managed on the serverside and you don't have to deal with CPanel stuff. And, who else will give you the software as well as hosting at this cheap rate? I am totally satisfied with Shopify and I am never going back to custom CMS of anything. Peace!","The most interesting thing about Shopify is that it needs no technical knowledge to get started. But that doesn't mean you can't use advanced features on this CMS. Using plugins, themes, templates all are quite easy on this platform and you don't need a full-time maintainer to manage your small business store made by using Shopify. Another great feature of Shopify is the integration with various payment gateways. No matter whether you are from the US or any other country, you can configure the payment gateway for a smooth transaction. Overall, it increases the conversion rate and revenue. There are a lot of premium and free themes developed for this platform and you can always make your site unique, fancy, and lightweight. The price is quite affordable I must say. Even if you use some other free CMS you will need to pay fr the hosting and CDN which are not reliable. But with Shopify, these things are taken care of and no matter how much traffic do you get, you can stay worry-free.","Honestly speaking I didn't find any major cons while using the software. I have some small stores as well as some big e-commerce shops running on Shopify and I didn't miss any features while building those. But I have a few suggestions about improving the product. For example, the mobile layout of the site should be more lightweight so that it loads faster on slow internet devices. Also, if you can introduce a free plan with limited features that will help most small businesses."
IT Director in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify Fit Our Needs Perfectly And Continues To Impress,"Until the end of 2020 we had a legal forms business, selling paper and electronic forms both in a storefront retail setting and via our website. We had to close the retail space and substantially streamline and simplify our website as it had been custom-coded and was complicated and expensive to maintain. Shopify offered a turnkey solution at a fraction of what we'd been paying – pretty much a no-brainer.","Setting up our company and its shop was very easy, as well as finding a visual theme that suited us and meshed well with our existing branding. There's a wealth of free themes, and countless additional paid ones, so it's hard to imagine anyone not finding what they need. Shopify's core functions are quite complete and comprehensive, but if you find there's something they don't do for you out of the box, chances are good that there's a third-party app that will answer the need, and usually for not very much additional expense.","Importing existing products into the store was a pretty big project (although of course, not all new store creators have 200-300 products they need to start up with like we did), and editing and/or customizing those products can be time-consuming and sometimes awkward. There are times when I'd really like to multiple-select several products and modify the same attribute for all of them, but the system doesn't support this. I have a feeling they'll add support for this kind of thing somewhere down the line."
Digital Marketing specialist in Nigeria,"Internet, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,One of my favourite ecommerce platforms,I use shopify to create ecommerce stores for my clients who specify that they want shopify or that aren't sure what platform they want their ecommerce built on. It is great if you are doing drop shipping and managing your inventory and orders is quite very easy.,"Shopify is easy to set up. You can set up your own ecommerce fast without needing to take a course or having a lot of technical knowledge. All you need do is pick a template that you like, use it as it is or style it to suit your brand or business.
Different plans that cater for different people. Whether you are just starting or you already have a lot of customers, you can chose a plan to grow your business with.
There are no server worries with shopify. It is fully hosted and you can be rest assured your website will load fast reducing your bounce rate.
It accepts a lot of external or third party apps that make your ecommerce store's functionality even better
The inventory module will let you know if you are running out of stock, easily manage your inventory.
It integrates perfectly well with most payment processors like PayPal, credit cards, and even Bitcoin payments and if you chose not to use third-party apps to collect payments, you can use shopify payments.","The only con I have with shopify is that they have control over all your site files since they host it. Unlike WordPress where you own your site a 100%, with shopify this isn't so.
It could get really expensive when you start adding other plugins to improve the functionality of your website."
Chief Creative in US,"Media Production, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify Symbolizes Seamless POS to Delivery Functionality,I enjoy seeing large and small business succeed with the same eCommerce platform. Shopify is used by so many retailers and this capacity is what makes the program so powerful. This diversity in the user base also enables Shopify developers to fine tune new product enhancements that are truly helpful in growing a business.,Chewing gum and walking at the same time can oftentimes be problematic for some. But with Shopify you don't have to worry about multi-tasking. The robust functionality of the eCommerce platform enables the user to create and implement a POS to delivery system that truly reflects the mission of the business enterprise. The ability to take a complex program and customize it to optimize the goals and objectives of the business is critical in today's competitive and challenging marketplace. Don't get lost in the noise from the implementation stage. Shopify is the ideal navigator of successful alignment and implementation.,"As with any conversion process, there are hurdles in the implementation. What I liked least was the learning curve, but this is true of any new product."
CEO in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is a very good platform for someone with a larger business and inventory. Its a 4.5 for me!,I will highly recommend Shopify to anyone as it helps you create a platform or a website which fits your niche. It is very secure and it has so many modes of accepting payments. They have a lot of seller features to improve sales.,"Here, you have a lot of features. No tech skills, no problem. If you understand how to use these features, you can create a very user friendly store with a beautify user interface. It is also very secure and reliable. Their customer support is also great since there have a 24/7 customer support service. You can accept both online payments and POS. They also have a mobile app which make the who experience so user friendly for the seller, from listing and inventory management to fulfilling orders. You can also create as many stores as you want, depending on the niche.","There is a monthly fee associated with Shopify, irrespective of your sales. Also, since you are creating a store from already established templates, full customization is limited. You also need to run ads or drive traffic to your store. If your store is still a new one, you have have low sales during the beginning."
Freelancer in Brazil,"Information Technology & Services, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Getting better Shopify,"Shopify, subsequently, is the ideal instrument for those looking for more noteworthy usefulness and better outcomes inside their web based business.","With guides focused on the individuals who are not exceptionally acquainted with instruments of this sort, one of the primary benefits of Shopify is its simple convenience. All things considered, with this internet business stage, you don't have to stress over the more specialized piece of the executives.
One more ideal point for the individuals who utilize this instrument is the ease of use and responsive plan of the layouts accessible to clients. At the end of the day, you can have confidence about the nature of your site both on the work area adaptation and for cell phones and cell phones.
For the individuals who don't have a lot of time to deal with every one of the undertakings of a business with the vital consideration, Shopify can work with even the administration of items and supply of your virtual store, for instance. Other than a remarkable and responsive plan, you can likewise deal with your web based business through the stage.","Notwithstanding offering Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques, Shopify utilizes some sub-catalogs that can hurt the SEO execution of your page. The URL of normal pages, for example, ""About Us"", don't have the ideal design to streamline your page's query items.
Area names are excluded from any of the accessible bundles. What's more, facilitating for your page should be bought. For facilitating an email with your own custom space, you need to search for an outside instrument, like G Suite, for instance. The believability of your image can be influenced with an email that isn't interesting, for instance.
On the off chance that your crowd is additionally global, Shopify may not be the most ideal choice for your business. All things considered, the device doesn't offer the likelihood to set up a multilingual store, for instance. That is, as indicated by your arrangements, this point can be a detriment for you"
president in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify Saved Our Business - And Made It Grow!,"Shopify literally saved our business. If we'd had to continue on WordPress, we never would have gained traction in the marketplace. Now I have been able to make my ecommerce business my sole full-time job, and we ship model horses around the world.","We started with a WordPress store in 2012 and it was a terrible hassle. It always needed to be updated and was subject to constant hacking attempts. We moved to Shopify in 2015 and our sales DOUBLED in the first year! They've continued growing every year since. Shopify handles updates and security wonderfully, leaving me free to do what I do best - Market and sell our items!","There are a few basic features that many of us have tried to get added for years, but Shopify instead chooses to have users fall back on apps to provide them, like branded packing slips, the ability to create another shipping label after an order has been shipped (in case an item was forgotten, or we want to send a promo item, etc), things like that. They are all available by using apps, which generate money for independent app developers, but that money comes from our budgets, so we wish they were built in."
"Music, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,Reviewer Source,5.0,Shopify is an amazing solution for e-commerce and selling directly to customers,"Overall, the experience with Shopify has been positive. It allows amazing functionality for direct-to-consumer purchase that is lacking on most platforms. The social media and marketing integrations are the best in the industry. Shopify automates sales with ease, and makes it easy for anyone to start a business and make their dreams into a reality.","Shopify is the best software I have found for selling and marketing directly to customers and fans. It takes a very hands on approach, but the integrations with social media, marketing, ads and the e-commerce capabilities are truly world class. I love how you can manage everything from the dashboard, and use apps to print on demand directly to customers, or sell your own products using the shipping integrations and automatic processing.","Shopify is amazing overall, but has some drawbacks. The interface is a bit clunky compared to other e-commerce platforms, and does not allow bulk edits. It is not ideal for businesses with massive product catalogs, as each product needs to be edited individually. The price can get high very fast, since a more expensive plan is required to get third party calculated shipping rates. The somewhat limited functionality of Shopify itself, requires additional apps, each with monthly subscriptions and higher costs. Shopify no longer refunds transaction fees when an item is returned, and this can be a deal-breaker for merchants with higher priced items. The software and apps like Shopify digital downloads also requires the disabling of the normal internet settings, to allow for cross website tracking in order to work properly, which is not typical of most e-commerce apps and raises some privacy concerns. Overall Shopify is great, but it is missing some basic key features and the issues above make it a questionable choice for some merchants."
Marketing Agency Owner in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Shopify Store Impact,I would recommend this product to somebody else if you are just beginning your journey with e-commerce and you do not want to waste a lot of time launching or developing a website.,I really like the user interface because it's not complicating to read or review and it doesn't take away time from any person that's just beginning to write or develop their own website.,"I do not like the paid website templates I think it should be more open sourced to integrate with sites such as WordPress and woocommerce so that more people can access this platform; however, I do understand they provide a holistic package for small to medium sized businesses which is much more affordable than some options."
Designer in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify makes everything easier,I love using Shopify because it’s user friendly and thus saves me a lot of time. The theme choices and app options are excellent do you can really enhance your website and make it look professional.,"It’s very user friendly with lots of options to help business growth and development. Customer service is fast and efficient. They are very helpful and friendly and easy to get a hold off. Constant updates and apps to add to your site means you stay up to date with new trends and features. Also Shopify integrates easily with a lot of things you need like Facebook catalogue, other wholesale sites etc. You can basically transfer over your inventory in 1 click. You also get great discounted rates on shipping.","It is more expensive than other options plus to integrate anything eg. Instagram, email newsletter function, galleries etc you need to pay for an app. Some apps are free but very few. A lot of features are only available on the more expensive pro plan."
Owner in US,"Cosmetics, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,Best Website Software for Building a Business!,"Shopify alleviated numerous headaches we were experiencing with Squarespace, made it easy for us to handle pickup and delivery orders (the ability to leave order notes and track an order's history are super helpful!) and has given us great insights into where our website traffic comes from.","We love Shopify's clean website templates, added features like live visitor counts and its thousands of app integrations. Using Shopify has given us the ability to truly understand our customers and their wants and needs through thorough reporting. While we don't currently use all of Shopify's features and apps, we love knowing that as our store grows and changes, the features and functionality of our Shopify store will too!","The administrative Shopify website often loads slowly, so completing basic tasks can sometimes be tedious. While it functions without this feature, we would appreciate it if it was possible to run multi-product purchase orders or inventory adjustments in Shopify - we currently have to increase the in-stock product quantity item-by-item when we receive new orders, which is time consuming."
Teacher in South Africa,"Primary/Secondary Education, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,The Software is only Effective if the Product is.,"It is important to note that I do not blame Shopify for a business's failure, it is merely the platform and spring-board and not the gymnast, the product you sell in your store matters and it is your job to dedicate your time, effort, and...Uhm...money to help your business succeed, and Shopify helped me with that and it was great and it can be great for anyone who makes use of this system or those planning to use it. Although, I wasn't kidding about the YT Tutorials, study the in and outs and hows and you'll do just great. Shopify offers its own tutorials but it's better to see people like you and me actually do it, practically, than to see it in theory.","I was on the road to entrepreneurship when I invested my time and money into Shopify, my eyes were wide with hope and it is important to note that this software requires training, extensive training. This software offers great functionality and is very in tune with the internet and allows you to stay in this Shopify bubble and do all that you need to do...HERE, in Shopify. The software becomes, very, user-friendly after a few Youtube tutorials, this study process shouldn't take more than a few hours for you to get the hang of this program and once you do, the simplicity is amazing. I was astounded and how connected this software is, not only to all social media but to other applications that can make your Shopify journey great and financially fruitful.","This is really my only gripe with this software...the price. Shopify dazzles you with the shimmering glow of entrepreneurship and the tasty smell of financial success, but that can only happen if you can afford the monthly premium that allows your store to stay open and those first few months are a doozy, especially if your business is taking a while to get its footing. We all hope that we can start a great business with zero capital, but that's a fantasy for the most part, and I wouldn't complain if all I had to pay for was the monthly subscription to Shopify, but I also had to pay for all those extra applications that would have helped my business flourish, all the little things added up and started to get daunting and expensive and made me feel like it wasn't worth it, but if you stick it out and if you have the right product, Shopify will help sky-rocket your business."
Owner in Canada,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,1.0,They promise the moon and provide a crumbling chunk of space rock,I couldn't move away from this platform fast enough.,"It's braindead easy for anyone with a modest set of technical skills to setup a store. (If you can use Facebook, you can use Shipify). Uploading files is a breeze and most menus seem to make some logical sense. The easy of initial setup is why so many scam sites use this platform-- anyone, even fraudsters love it. But that doesn't make it a good platform!","The platform is quite costly compared to other options. It doesn't come with enough features to work on its own so users are stuck having to pay for add-on modules. And these are not a straight-up purchase but come with a monthly fee. I calculated the modules I would need and it was going to run me $500-$800 USD/month! It has been cheaper to build a Magento site and pay cash up front, one time, for modules I will use for the lifetime of my site.
The service at Shopify was appalling. I contacted support with a problem on their server that the tech couldn't help resolve but refused to patch me through to someone else. This happened every time I called in (4 times with similar issues on their end).
Payout is offered in one currency and once a week. Not at all flexible or professional.
The final dealbreaker was when they sold me a 3rd party theme that was replaced 2 days later by the vendor with a better theme, and the vendor would have refunded me but said it was up to Shopify to refund. Shopify refused and the Vendor was very apologetic and said they heard all the time from customers how unprofessional Shopify's policies were.
I have since noticed how many fly-by-night scammer sites and sites selling counterfeit goods are on the Shopify platform. Though these are rarely shut down, honest sites sometimes are. I feel much safer hosting my site on my terms and without worry they, under their user agreement, can terminate my site whenever they choose."
"Health, Wellness & Fitness, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,4.0,Quick and Easy to Use,"A few years ago we were having issues with the security implementation on our WooCommerce site. We switched to Shopify and to be honest, it is much easier for our customer service people to use. Although, editing the code may be a little more difficult, it is not anything that anyone should really be afraid of. There is a pretty active community forum for help as well as the help desk has answered my questions when I have had them as well.","I find that it is pretty easy to create products and make them go live. Further, the fact that Shopify provides the hosting and therefore, the security for the site is quite amazing. I also like that Shopify is a major player in the marketplace. So many times I have had to go for knock offs and Shopify is not that.","Having been a guy that had never edited liquid files before, that was new to me, but finding what I need to edit and adjust in the code is really not that difficult. There is a lot of help available for this too. I do find that there are not as many apps to connect to your site as there is with WooCommerce. That is also connected to the security aspect as well though as sometimes having too many apps allows for more opportunities for things to go wrong."
Director of Marketing and Direct-to-Consumer Accounts in US,"Consumer Goods, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The Best E-commerce Platform,"I'm very satisfied with Shopify. It's really the best in its class, and I have recommended it regularly to friends and family members who are looking for an e-commerce solution.","When I launched Shopify originally, I was looking for a solution that would accommodate online sales for my organization as well as in-person sales at our conferences. I had physical and digital items, and I needed something could take care of it all. That's what I found in Shopify. It was easy to implement and it helped the organization increase sales 35% YoY. Since then, I've launched a half dozen Shopify sites, and I just love how easy and flexible the platform is.","My only complaint about Shopify is how much of the platform requires apps. There are a lot of things that some of their competitors offer as a part of the platform that Shopify leaves to their app developers, and it's hard to get nickle-and-dimed when I want to add subscriptions or gift messages or anything else."
President/C.E.O in US,"Real Estate, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify Review,"It has truly been a very wonder asset to my company as well as other companies I am associated with. Its ease to not only display products, get the word out, and interface with other websites for maximum exposure is excellent. The ability to track sales, and collect funds virtually anyway possible is great. Their customer service and care is way better than most companies. Finally, the ability to use it on so many devices allows for almost any player independent contractor, etc. to be able to convert products into sales anywhere with a cash register basically in their pocket.","The product is very easy to use, contains multiple components beneficial to any business, and customer support is fabulous. All of its portals are self explanatory for the most part. In the rare occasion something is not understood or an error occurs, customer service is very thorough in helping solve the issue. They don't make you feel uneducated, or like you're bothering them, often they offer tips and tricks to help make your overall content better. I have personally spoken with many support people whom also have shopify accounts. They were nothing but a pleasure to speak with. Also, whether drop shipping, selling own products/services, or almost any type of business that exchanges money, this has it all. From manual entry sales, to point of sale systems, to cash payments, it tracks everything, and provides multiple options so customers have a choice in how to pay. Its ability to allow multiple people to log in such as employees or other people allowed to make sales with such ease is wonderful. The best part, is it can be accessed through any computer, smartphone, tablet, etc.. No need for expensive software or register machines anymore.","There really is not much I can say negative. For what they offer, they are pretty much spot on. Maybe the fact its not free.. :) but nothing this good could, nor should be free."
Scott M. Cohn in US,"Media Production, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,"Don't Shop Around, Shop-ify!","Overall, Shopify has been good to me. They made me a Partner because of the – you know I can't actually recall what the criteria was to become one – maybe you just apply to become one. But if you are a Partner, you can develop stores at no cost, and then get paid a referral fee and a residual for transferring it to a paying client. A very nice gesture towards us store-builders – I wish all creative software or SaaS platforms were as fiscally friendly. They also make it easy for devs looking to expand into Shopify App creation – so they can be on the receiving end of that sweet, month-to-month autocharged booty.","Shopify is where it's at if you want to get involved in the whole Direct 2 Consumer craze! You could literally have a store, up and running and transactional in 10 minutes assuming you're computer / web literate, have a bank account, and a product to sell...For getting up and running with hundreds of attractive themes to choose from (not all on Shopify.com, there are online stores that sell themes...) you really can't beat the ease of Shopify – with just the right amount of freedom, and automation to make sure you can get your products and logo looking their best, and not accidentally break the whole thing. And if you know a little HTML/CSS, the sky is really the limit in terms of customizing the theme. Plus there's a Shopify ""App Store"" that offers every possible function you could imagine if you wanted something not natively offered such as pop-ups, rewards clubs, or wholesale pricing.","In the beginning, I found it a bit cumbersome to deal with large catalogs with lots of variants (color / size) per sku. But Shopify and their lightning-fast chat support are nothing if not good listeners and they've made editing part of, or your whole catalog, much easier than ever before, with tons of filters for tailoring your product selection on the back end, to making almost any variable from Title, to Inventory, to Weight, easily bulk editable. So the thing I'll say that still stinks, is that all the apps charge subscription fees, which is super annoying, especially if you rely on a bunch of them. I would much rather pay a one and done license fee as opposed to $3 a month for my mailing list manager app, $16 a month for my Wholesale price tiering app, and $5 for my abandoned cart retrieval system. It adds up to a big, never-ending headache."
IT Manager in US,"Law Enforcement Software, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,I LOVE Shopify,"It's been a highly successful project. We went from having an idea to having a very successful website within a year. Upkeep is a breeze and they are always improving their software. In the 2.5 years we have been using Shopify software, I have never had to contact support or interact with Shopify about any issues. It just works.","Shopify made launching a new website super easy. We had an idea to start selling a new product line that differed from what we were already doing, so we decided to create a new website. Shopify made it easy to design our website, create a product catalog and start selling. Shopify is low-cost but feature rich. They blow away the competition when it comes to launching new, and established E-commerce websites. It took less than 6 months from signing up to selling. Our store has been very successful and I credit that to how easy Shopify made the whole process.","My only complaint is that we cannot use ""Shopify Payments"" to process credit cards for our product line. We have to use an external credit card processor and that makes it more expensive. Shopify charges additional fees if you do not use their in house Credit Card Processor, but will not waive fees when they do not allow you to use their processor."
"Manager, Operations and Finance in US","Pharmaceuticals, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Simple and Easy E-commerce platform!,When we launched our web store back in 2016 we looking for something simple yet robust. After reviewing with several e-platform software we decided to try Shopify and haven't really looked back. I would recommend it to anyone looking to start up their own e-commerce site.,"Love the simplicity of it. Shopify made it was easy to create/build/manage our own web store. The monthly fees are reasonable and the transaction fees are low if you compare it to selling on Amazon. It gives us an alternative platform to sell with the potential for higher margins/profits. In terms of designing your website, Shopify's themes and tools allowed us to create a simple yet elegant web store. On the back end, it's fairly easy and straightforward to manage your store. Shopify also provides a lot of in-depth analytics to help you understand your customers and provide potential insights on how to improve sales. Shopify also integrates seamlessly with our Stitch inventory software which in turn syncs to our Shipstation for shipping (Shopify: front web store > Stitch: inventory software > Shipstation: shipping software). I think for anyone who has the desire to sell online, Shopify is definitely a solution for you.","1. Managing discount codes can get tricky if you have recurring/subscription orders. Recurring/subscription orders requires a plug-in called Bold and it applies discount codes differently from the Shopify platform (one-time purchases). Meaning if you wanted to have the same discount code, with the same discount applied, and applicable to one-time orders and recurring/subscription order, then that discount codes need to be entered in both Shopify and Bold. The method/calculation to enter in discount codes in both Shopify & bold are different as well. There's just a bit of extra work here. Also, once a Bold discount code is created it cannot be edited once saved. Shopify discount codes are editable after it's created and saved.
2. Another thing about Bold plug-in is when you update an existing recurring/subscription customer's order you can't instantly push an order through. You must wait until it processed through its auto-order process which for us is close to midnight local time. It'll be great if you're on the phone with a customer to have the ability to say the updates are completed, everything looks good, and we've processed the order, and it will be shipped right away. Right now, the quickest you can get the order processed is basically the next day."
Solutions Engineer in US,"Computer Software, 501–1,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is a GAMECHANGER if you Run an Ecommerce Business,I don't think we will ever leave Shopify. It's affordable and easy to use - what more could you want from a product that is used to run your business.,"I can't stress enough how much I LOVE Shopify. I run my mom's business for her (an ecommerce site) and we set up the entire thing from scratch, with little knowledge of the platform. They have both free and paid templates to choose from for your site and they are very customizable. The fact that these templates scale to mobile with zero input from us is incredible We've been using it for over 5 years and we couldn't be happier. It is SO easy to use. Their customer support is unmatched - they are open 24 hours and always help us through even the most simple kinds of questions (""how do I upload a new image?""). The inventory feature is great and keeps everything organized. If you sell an item offline, you can easily adjust inventory in your dashboard so no mistakes are made.","There aren't many things I don't like about Shopify. I think my biggest ask is that there should be more free templates available for use. The Shopify made templates are the best because they integrate seamlessly with the product. For some users, software is a scary thing, so instead of jumping to buy a cooler template, I think users would be responsive to more free templates to try."
OWNER in US,"Wholesale, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,1.0,Thought I was signing up for an Integrated POS System and Website,Feels like Shopify sucks you in and is not transparent. When you realize what the system doesn’t do...they apologize and are very kind but not very helpful. There are a bunch of awkward apps you can buy to fix the problems but they don’t work very well. Wish someone would just make an easy functioning system that met business that sell inventory on line and in person.,It is easy to get a website up and running. Adding products is easy.,"WHERE DO I BEGIN:
-inventory records only go back three months...I was horrified to find out I lost 4 months of inventory records.
-to print a receipt...you need to buy and download an app...it is awkward to use and takes a couple minutes for the receipt to upload before you can print it.
-to have employees log in you need to download and app and pay monthly
-you can not do a credit on someone’s account if they return something...You need to either return their money or give them a gift card it is awkward and difficult to use.
-if you mark an order pending payment you cannot take payment on the POS system.
-you cannot add any vender information that is not visible to your customers.
-the duplicate feature when adding products doesn’t work properly....to hard to explain what should be duplicated and what shouldn’t but trust me it wasn’t created by someone that understands business"
owner in Spain,"E-Learning, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,"Why I chose Shopify (but also use other platforms, too)","I'm a fan - their customer service is excellent, and I've never had any issues with downtime or anything like that.","I have an online shop to support my podcast on Tudor history. I originally set up my shop thinking I'd sell some fun leggings using print on demand vendors. And it's grown into a bit of a behemoth. Which is great! Here's the thing - lots of creators use Redbubble and Spreadshirt and other places like that, which is fine, but the difference is that when you do that, they handle the entire sales process. This is fine if you don't want to know your customers, but if you're running an online business, then being able to capture that sales information, and get mailing list sign ups, is crucial .
You can still use print on demand vendors, only this time you control the entire sales process. Everything is branded for your business. The tags in the leggings are branded for you. The mailing address is your company. It's all yours.
Of course, the downside is that you also have to handle the customer service questions that would normally go to the Zazzle equivalent. But if you are really wanting to build a business around your customers, you want that touch point. And you get to keep all the profits.
With all the apps, you can have a store that really expresses who you are, and lets you control the entire sales process.","I'm not a fan of how much is only included in the more expensive options, and how much is only available through paid apps. Of course it's great to have the options at all, but it's very easy to start to run up high bills. At one point I was paying close to $100/mo for all my various apps!
I also still use other marketplaces like Etsy because it's the distinction between selling at a church craft fair and setting up your own shop. At the church craft fair you're pretty much guaranteed some kind of traffic. With setting up on your own you have more control over the feel, and ownership of the shop, but it's up to you to go out and get all the traffic."
Head of Technology in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Hands down the easiest eCommerce platform,I resisted Shopify for a long time because I absolutely love WooCommerce and the concept of open source software. Over the years Shopify has won me over with it's ease-of-use.,"Shopify is the easiest eCommerce platform and offers an excellent combination of ease-of-use and power. I love WooCommerce (have used it for site builds since 2012), but Shopify has become my new go-to for basic eCommerce builds in recent years. If you know what you're doing you can literally get a simple Shopify site up and running in less than 2 hours.
The plugin and theme marketplaces on Shopify are phenomenal. They're not as extensive as the WP plugin marketplaces, but the overall quality is better, making up for the quantity gap. There are still a few holes compared to something like WooCommerce, but Shopify will do 95% of what you could imagine doing on an eCommerce site, and do it easier than anyone else.
Stability may be the biggest selling point of Shopify. Because you don't control the server, database, or mid-tier code, the hard maintenance is all done by Shopify automatically. Most serious eCommerce businesses make back their subscription just in the maintenance cost savings.","Shopify is not nearly as flexible as something like WooCommerce or Magento because you don't have access to the server's backend code or the database. This makes it harder (and sometimes even impossible) to build out really sophisticated solutions to difficult data oriented problems. That said, those kinds of problems are rare and most businesses will be able to find alternative solutions.
Shopify is going to run you $30/month+. Compared to a lot of the open source options out there this can feel expensive. Apps can drive that price higher very quickly. For most small businesses they're going to find themselves paying $50-$100/month for the features they need to drive their online sales. If you're willing to go without some functionality (or find a free alternative) you can keep that cost in the $30-$50/month range."
"Product Owner, CRO Services in US","Marketing & Advertising, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The only platform I would use for Ecommerce,"I work with a lot of websites that are ecommerce-based, and the headaches you'd expect to come with complex ecosystems are so much less frequent with Shopify than they are with Magento, BigCommerce, etc.","From startup stores to enterprise solutions, Shopify has a structure that any site can use (and excel with). The templates available give each store a 'custom' feel, and the platform-side checkout solution prevents a lot of hiccups and downtime that would be caused by inexperienced developers trying to manipulate that crucial step in the funnel.","Lately (fall 2019), Shopify has had quite a bit of downtime. Because they host so many stores, it appears their servers can get overwhelmed during heavy seasons, causing slower responses and even causing stores to crash. Since the stores are all somewhat linked, this can cause issues for a large amount of stores, killing sales and harming customer reputation."
Marketing Coordinator in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,"If you run a shop, you need to use Shopify!","Overall Shopify can be an extremely helpful platform for a company that is running an online store. It makes both the front and back end seamless for everyone. Once I took the time to learn my way around the website I realized that there is so much that Shopify can do, and it makes us running our company a lot easier than if we tried to build an online shop ourselves. Our whole team now utilizes Shopify on a daily basis and we love everything about it, from the retail functions right down to the design.","I love that we can provide an easy-to-use online store for our customers and seamlessly connect it to everything on the backend. I love the customization that the apps in Shopify provide, and we are utilizing things like shipping & inventory, bundle discounts, upselling, random coupons, email collection, and much more. The number of apps provided makes it easy to find the right one for your store. Our backend support team can easily view and fulfill orders and we can handle customer service right from our site. It's easy to set up and constantly update. I love that Shopify has made running an online store easy for both our management team and customer base.","Unfortunately since there are so many apps offered, it does take some time to sort through and find the right one for you. Some of them are not as customizable than others, and it can be tough to learn your way around the building platform but luckily Shopify and the app developers have awesome support teams. I'm also not a fan that you can't physically drag and drop widgets on your website like Wix can, and sometimes you need to teach yourself a bit of HTML to edit things (although again, their support team is great for helping with this). However, these are small inconveniences compared to the vast functionality of Shopify."
Trainer in Nigeria,"Marketing & Advertising, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Want to start Drop Shipping? Meet Shopify!,"Generally, Shopify has been an awesome service. I was able to build many sites with it. Ecommerce and Drop shipping is very easy with Shopify. With Shopify, I didn't have to bother about hosting my store or making my site secure. All these were taken care of by Shopify.","I love many things about Shopify. Honestly, I've not fallen in love with any other alternative as much as I have with Shopify. The pros of Shopify includes:
1. No Hosting required: This is a beautiful part of Shopify. With Shopify, I never had to worry about purchasing a hosting plan. Shopify hosts all merchant accounts on their server.
2. Free SSL: I love this a lot. With some other alternatives, a user may need to purchase an SSL certificate to keep his/her site safe, but not with Shopify. Shopify provides free SSL for all users.
3. Easy to use: With Shopify, I was able to get up and running in about half an hour. No programming skills required. Customising and tweaking everything can be done in about an hour. This is beautiful compared to alternatives.
4. Free trials: Shopify allows a new user to tryout it's services for complete two weeks without paying any money if the user desires. Being curious, I had to try the free service before deciding to make any purchase.
5. Easy to install apps: Shopify have apps to help users add functionalities to their websites. The apps are very easy to install. Their are both free and premium apps on Shopify.
6. Easy payment collection: Shopify has it's own payment system for users. This allows users collect payment for products and services from their customers. The payment processing fee varies from plan to plan.
7. Easy to integrate with drop shipping services: A large chunk of Shopify users are drop shippers. This is a plus.","Inasmuch as I so much love Shopify, honestly, there are a few turn offs. They include:
1. Expensive: For a starter, Shopify may be very expensive compared to alternatives like woocommerce. With woocommerce, a user can build a free forever ecommerce/ drop shipping site. The user only need to purchase a hosting service and an SSL certificate if need be.
2. Some apps are not available: I opted to using another payment gateway other than Shopify's. The issue I had was that I couldn't find the app for my desired payment processor on the App store. By this, I was compelled to use another payment processor.
3. Premium Apps: Shopify apps helps users add features to their websites. The con here is that many of the apps are premium apps, and should be paid for. This means that apart from the money one have to pay to use Shopify, the one still need to pay some more to have his/her desired apps installed. This can be a turn off for newbies, and others users.
Apart from those cons, Shopify is a beautiful app to use."
Owner in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is Go To for Building Any eCommerce Physical Product Store,Shopify is amazing. Building an e-commerce website on your own or with a developer is ultimately complex. Shopify has made this a simple experience. Building your own eCommerce site typically would require you to pay for a lot of things in all different places such as hosting with GoDaddy and a URL and then you need to buy all this different plugins from different developers. It becomes a headache. Your site can also crash and get buggy as a result. Shopify is an all-in-one solution and will usually never crash unless all of Shopify is under maintenance. It's just a really great software and a must use if you're building an eCommerce website for the first time. You can start with Shopify and most likely find all the features you need to keep your site there for the long haul.,"Shopify allows even a beginner to build a really nice looking, responsive eCommerce site. You offer templates that you know help store owners be more successful. They are already designed really well and someone just needs to switch out elements to make the store their own. You made it easy to buy a domain, a template and hosting all in one place. You also have it easy to setup your sales tax which on platforms like Magento and Wordpress can requires additional plugins that can be a headache. You connect well with distribution channels such as Amazon and eBay and I can manage my inventory quantities all in one place.","Cons is of course with any DIY software limitations within the software. You also to customize this need to work with developer who really knows Shopify and deep coding experience, versus building a website on Wordpress, millions of developers know wordpress, Shopify has less true experts to choose from."
Business Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify for the win!,I love that shopify will scale with my business and that there are various pricing plans that give you different options and shipping discounts. It's easy to use and has other apps that work with it so I can easily generate line sheets and product catalogues.,"I love that shopify integrates seamlessly into my inventory program, social media accounts, email marketing platform, etc. They also work really well with google ads so you can add products to google shopping and run really effective retargeting ads. Their live view option is great and gives me an idea of where my customers are coming from.
Their shipping discounts are also great!","The only thing that really annoys me is that I can't pick which shipping option comes first. Because one of my shipping options is ""local pickup"" and is free, I'd rather that not be the default shipping option (a lot of out of town customers accidentally choose local pickup and then I have to contact them and it looks unprofessional). Apart from that, it's a great platform"
Institute Director in US,"Health, Wellness & Fitness, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,The Shopify platform is a richly supported online and retail solution,"I've attended a Shopify master class speaker event, done some studying along a roadmap towards certifications on the platform, and I've begun some nominal work upon creating web stores as a developer seeking to start establishing an E-commerce and brand management solution.","There are many aspects to the Shopify software platform, including 3rd party app development, e-commerce, retail Point-of-Sale hardware, affiliate programs for referring merchants, professional learning articles and paths to professional certifications of the Shopify platform.
In addition, the Shopify experience, for users, admins, developers, partners, etc. is richly engaging with Shopify retail store events, here in downtown Los Angeles. Shopify's retail store presence features master classes from professionals who have successfully launched brands and online and physical stores using Shopify's technology and features, as well as their own third party establishments which integrate nicely within the Shopify platform.","There's a high learning curve to establishing a professional web presence in an E-commerce setting, and many steps and lessons to learn along the way, but for dedicated developers and entrepreneurs, the Shopify app is a truly viable tool for establishing an E-commerce web presence."
Owner in Ireland,"Cosmetics, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,User-friendly platform that covers (almost) all your e-commerce needs,"Shopify is still my first pick after almost a decade working with E-commerce, but with a much lesser margin than before. Squarespace and Wix offer, in my opinion, good alternatives if you don't want to put up with constantly wondering ""Why isn't this function in place? Oh, I have to install an app and pay X$ every month"". I would recommend Shopify for those who don't require a lot beyond the standard E-commerce solution and/or won't mind paying a bit for some pro templates and apps.","Shopify is extremely user-friendly and easy to set up. It's intuitive even if you've never used an e-commerce platform before, and you're able to get by with no coding skills. The basic templates are plain, but professional and modern. Basically it covers everything you need to get started with an online business, the pricing model is fair, and there's a wealth of 3rd party plugins and templates if you require something beyond the standard functionalities.","Though I've put the 3rd party marketplace as a benefit, I'm also left with the feeling that it comes with a hidden downside. Basic functions such as bundling and customer messages on an order (which, to give an example, Etsy offers) requires a 3rd party plugin with Shopify. After so many years in the industry, I'm baffled as to why this hasn't been implemented by default. The only reason I can think of is, why would they? Customers are forced to buy an app, which makes more money for Shopify. Another pet peeve example: You cannot use more than 1 discount code unless you install an app. Which means, you can't put 10% off the entire site, and offer customers an additional discount with a code."

"Entertainment, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,5.0,I use Shopify for all my Ecommerce Businesses,"I built both shopify stores from scratch without prior knowledge and it took me about a full week to get the hang of things. I would make adjustments as I could to help convert customers. I still feel like it's the best place to only sell products but still a bit costly to make a really nice design. I now hire virtual assistants to make all the changes on the site and manage it but that can cost too so it's great there are API's to help grow the business, which all cost more money though, some are free (Reddit, pinterest).","Sleek designs, easy to use, easy to keep track of products and sales, great third party API integrations and marketing software, and simple to run. Many Virtual Assistants already know how to use this software which makes life very easy for me.
The simpler, the better. I have several shopify stores and I aim to make passive income in this realm.","Templates are limited, a lot of the development is backend yet I'm a visual person so I like to see everything as I'm doing it, and it can get a little overwhelming with all the integrations needed to turn a Shopify store into a massive profitable business. I feel like the best templates cost too much money and the ones we are offered look basic and not easily customizable. It could use a better blog feature section and a bit more visual aspects such as videos to help pitch or promote the business. Maybe even used for online courses with private logins would be great."
Senior Account Executive - Commercial Print in US,"Retail, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,OK but MUCH room for improvement,2014 = great,"When I first signed up for Shopify 4-5 years ago I thought it was the best thing to happen to ecommerce. Gurus were knowledgeable and accessible (via phone!), the product worked beautifully and it met my needs. Now that my business has grown and I'm finding that Shopify is not set up to handle a business of high growth. Shopify has grown so fast that the average conversation with a Guru has dropped from outstanding to barely acceptable. Most of the time, the I know more than the Gurus. Follow up from the gurus is also terrible. You can still reach them by phone but if you need to speak to someome in the company with more experience, you can only access them via email and they take FOREVER to get to you. So you can forget about getting any help from someone with real knowledge of the product. The native functionality is also only good for very basic businesses. For example, if you need to ship a single item in multiple boxes, you can forget about doing that natively in the app or taking advantage of their discounted shipping rates. If you want to get a custom app built, you can forget about getting any support on the API from the gurus because they don't know anything about API. Again, there is no escalation point for customers who have a higher level of needs. Want help from the Shopify Expert community? You can forget about being called and speaking to someone local. Most won't do it, I've tried. If you get a response, the best you'll get is an email that reads something alo","ng the lines of ""I can do this for you."" and it's from someone on the other side of the world that has no clue about you, your business, your country or it's customs. I could go on and on but in summary, I am HIGHLY disappointed with the level of support and in 4 years have gone from a loyal, enthusiastic customer to a highly disgruntled customer looking for new options."
Instructional Designer in US,", 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Very easy to get started with advanced features for those who need it,"For the price of the software, it is hard to complain about anything. It is super easy to set up and manage, tons of usability and plugins for advanced features, great customer service.","Shopify is very easy to get started with. It practically holds your hand with simple shops and the plugins make for a robust software that almost anyone can make use of. I use it primarily for selling eLearning courses. Shopify has plugins available for most LMS software. Simply connect the LMS to Shopify with a plugin, input the course identifier, with my LMS it is a string of numbers and letters that is unique to each course, then set the price and start selling. When you sell a course through Shopify, the purchaser automatically gets login information for the LMS and is automatically assigned the course they purchased. Shopify has a couple of options for setting up a shop. The first option, which is the easiest, is to create a storefront within Shopify that is like a website, just for your store. It is very easy to pick a theme and then just type in the information. The storefront through Shopify looks very professional and is worth it if you just need a simple storefront. The second option is the buy button, which I use for my companies website. This way, if you already have a website, you can just use Shopify to generate a code that will give you a button to place on your website. There are other options I rarely use such as generating a code for email which is similar to the buy button but I am sure it would be very useful for those wishing to email out their products. There are so many plugins to sell different ways that there would be too much to post in this review. The customer service is top-notch. They respond quickly and when I needed something, they worked with me until it was resolved. The last customer service need I had took a few tries to get everything going but they kept at it until it was fixed.","The only con I have is for a lot of the advanced usage, you will need plugins for anything beyond selling simple items, like I said before, this is a pro but it can be a con at the same time. Some of the plugins are simple and free but a lot have an extra cost to either purchase the plugin or a monthly fee to use the plugin. The creators of the plugins do need the pay, that is understandable, but most are out of small businesses', like my company's, budget."

We can do pretty much everything ourselves without having to hire coders or designers.
Also, I don't need to worry if the servers are down if the store will be slow because of an increase of traffic, basically Shopify accommodates my growth without I need to do anuthing","The one thing that bugs me, is that I don't have the ability to do many configurations on the checkout page.

A great platform to utilise for the ecosystem to speedily establish an idea, develop an enterprise safely in accordance with the idea, set up easily, and conduct the business in various locations.","The dashboard is very easy to assemble, and it really has lots of helpful functions for safe and sound use. It has a wide range of topics developed using current methods and contains no problem at all for us.
There are various payment gateways we choose that makes it possible to receive payments with greater ease.
Integration with various other software is great.
There are a number of website themes available for use in creating a web store, making it much simpler to design an effective store with each characteristic.","Shopify has various apps that are exceptional with regard to execution, but they are costly like inventory management, developing multiple volume-specific discount codes, and greater customisability.
The main drawback that Shopify has is that it lacks dedicated applications for handling software for free.
The need for an entirely new language is probably going to require a freelance developer for major alterations."

No programming knowledge is required and there are many fine templates to choose from, and you can always find more. If you are interested in starting online, Shopify is a good choice because it offers a PCI compliant and secure shopping cart and payment gateway solution. Adding products to Shopify is surprisingly fast and easy but you are limited to 100 Variants. Shipping integration with USPS, UPS and Fedex is included and integrates with many popular software via Add ons. Things like email marketing, product feeds, and popups are easy to find and setup. And you can export your products to Google, and setup customer reviews with some other add ons. Having all these extra with add ons is both good and bad, and customers should be aware of the small downsides to Shopify.","Most things come included, however any extra customization requires some kind of add-on with monthly charge. Thankfully they have a good amount of add-ons to choose from, but most have fake reviews. Shopify much like other modern shopping carts is unable to store credit cards, out of the box. If your business needs to charge a customer for re-shipping, you have to create an invoice each time using an addon or creating a new order. Customer support is responsive but very general, but the basic Shopify will suit most small business owners. I am however not like most people, and like more customization. You cannot customize things too much other than what templates and add ons offer. Development on Shopify is highly difficult and goes above and beyond html / css however you can make some small changes like adding an image, or a link, a variable, or a tracking script with a look in their help center."

Is it because of some blog post you've made? Is it because of the Facebook campaign? Is it from Google Ads or pure organic traffic? Now those are good problems to have to be honest, but when it comes to that I've experienced a lot of issues in determining those details. There are number of reports to give you an insight where the traffic is coming from, but to my personal preferences I find it lacking in details.

It is completely focused on bringing your e-commerce site to market and overall makes this easier for people who want to try and do it themselves. However, once I really began wanting to develop my site further I found the limitations, monthly expense and overall satisfaction did not meet my needs. If you intend to grow into a much larger store with the ability to truly customize your site then it's better to not start on Shopify to begin with.

This means that if you don't know how to code you will be paying someone to make any changes to your site that the templates don't accomodate. It also means that if you ever want to move your store to another platform, you can't.

It's super easy to set up and get you going for all your online needed. They also have great support as well and you get a 14-day free trial as well.
It also comes with free themes to make your store look attractive.","This is great for your business in the beginning, but not so good for the long run.
If you want to expand your store, then it gets expensive to use their plans which offer more features and customization.

CEO in Chile,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,A good tool for developing online stores,"I must admit that since using Shopify my store conversions have increased, this is due to the UI, because it is much faster and more effective than WooCommerce (which sometimes gets slow in the Checkout section) with Shopify I have never had any problems in operation. And the support is very good.","It is the most complete platform to develop an online store, it has a good UI, it is very fast and intuitive for customers, it depends on the theme you choose but most of them are very fast and functional. I like that it has a marketplace of applications that can be integrated to improve the performance of my store.","The sales commissions are the disadvantage of this company, 2% per sale in the basic plan. When selling in high volume the amount is very high. When I use a lot of applications the amount I have to pay monthly for my store increases. I also don't like that being a SaaS platform the store code belongs to Shopify, so if I want to migrate my website I can't, I can only migrate products, customers and other limited features."

Partner in UK,"Publishing, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Experiences from using Shopify over 5 years,I would give shopify top marks if it wasn't for the duplicate customer issue. Had I know about it I would never have chosen it in the first place.,"It is very flexible and does most things for a simple shop using the free themes and apps, however you will need IT skills to customise it further - or pay for specialised apps.
It is fairly easy to manage customers and orders using online or the POS application.","The major omission is the inability to merge customer accounts - which often happens when customers change email or mistype when placing orders. What is worse is that this has been requested by many many merchants for over seven years via multiple support and feature requests and in a dozen or so threads on the community forum and shopify have simply ignored it.
As I run a primarily magazine subscription business having a clean customer database is essential."

Shopify is definitely one of the cheapest ways to sell online:
I started with the 3 month free period during the pandemic, I tried the $ 9 / month starter plan to sell an unlimited number of items,
I took advantage of many useful features, such as the ability to sell products also from the Facebook page.
But you can use Shopify in a physical store for both purchases and to manage the warehouse,
and above all use the Shopify Buy Button, which allows you to sell through blogs or pre-existing websites.","The limit of the three options per product,
the transaction fees,
the fact that, in some cases, it is necessary to install an app to have a certain function.

Marketing & Operations Manager in US,"Retail, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Highly recommend for all eCommerce,I can't imagine using any other platform for our website/sales home base. We actually acquired another company using a different platform for their website and are looking to migrate as soon as possible.,"Shopify is both simple and powerful. An individual could easily set it up on their own, but there are lots of options and great features if you have a team/experience.","While you can achieve most things via the various apps that are available, there is some functionality that seems like it should be available natively in Shopify. For instance, there isn't built-in functionality for customers to filter products while browsing. If you have more than just a few products, this is very necessary. You can take care of it with apps, but it would nice if things like this were available from Shopify out of the box."
Owner in US,"Consumer Goods, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Best E-commerce Platform,"I moved over from a different e-commerce platform and the difference between them and Shopify could not be more apparent.

Their app store is excellent, and their website templates are great.",Shopify is well priced and has an extensive app library that you can purchase and install. This makes Shopify very customizable to your business needs.,"There are some features that I wish were built in for better functionality... like the ability to have nested product options.

- Shopify ensures all software and plugins updated frequently for security.
- Excellent program for dropshipping.","- Many needed functionalities, such as product reviews, not included and involve installing paid-for apps which are expensive and can slow down website and affect performance.
- Cost can add up and becomes very expensive with subscription fee, transaction fees, credit card fees, and plugin fees.
- Product images not cropped automatically to uniform ratio. Required to be done separately and manually.
- Limit of 3 options with limited number of product variants up to 100.
- Rudimentary blogging functionality.
- No automatic breadcrumbs by default. Users need to be knowledgeable to make changes to activate breadcrumbs.
- Shopify's jargons are non-universal and can be confusing for new users."
EA in India,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Best E-commerce platform in the market,I have tried several similar platforms but Shopify is hands down the best E-commerce platform in the market. Definitely will recommend to all new entrepreneurs who are trying to learn drop shipping.,"Shopify is the best platform for drop shipping and also for retailers who want to take their shop online.
Anyone with no previous experience with web designing can also easily set up a shop and start selling globally.
The dashboard is very user friendly and they also have tips and instructions displayed upfront to help you set up easily.
It also has a 14 day trial that allows you to set up things and check out if your products are working.
The customer service team is also quick to respond, I was not able to attach my card to one of my stores due to some issues with my bank and when I informed them that I was not able to take my shop online because of this and the trial period was about to come to an end and they extended the trial for me in just one request made via email.
Once your website is set up it also has additional applications to help you add inventory, up sell products, send automatic emails, track orders, basically all that you will ever need to run an online store is taken care off all under one platform.
I would rate it 10/10","Shopify has no cons to be honest.
Everything works fine from the day you set it up and you do not need to patch or upgrade anything ever.
The basic fee per month is also money well spent for all the amazing features.
Its all just upto you to market your products and get sales to keep ur shop running."
Accountant in Jordan,"Food Production, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,From Wordpress blog to Shopify store,"To be short, so many less complications.",Shopify is the most user-friendly eCommerce platform. I appreciate that we can give our consumers with an easy-to-use online store that is flawlessly connected to everything on the backend. Oh and the call to action button at the front page is my favorite! And I think Shopify templates are designed with thoughts behind them. they're modern and up-to-date that even a first-timer can build a great shop that is able to exist in the competitive market without a doubt.,"One con that I've struggled with honestly is at first, when we started we used a free template. And it's that most free templates don't offer the Arabic language or they offer the language to a limit ad you'll have to manually translate everything else. I remember spending hours just translating and sometimes I translate and don't know where the translation lands on the review page. We had to get it audited by 3 people. A month ago we started using a paid template and there's still some translation needed just way way less than the free one's."

After switching to Shopify, I was so mad that I didn't just start with them. They were made for e-commerce and other platforms just don't compare.","Shopify is super easy to use for people, like me, who have no web design/development experience. Shopify also has a ton of apps and integration options with other platforms. I can connect my Shopify store to anything I need to. Shopify is also always upgrading features and taking suggestions from users. I love the data I'm able to get, with the middle tier plan.","Honestly, the few areas of improvement I had, have been resolved. Shopify is good about listening to their users."

I like that the system is intuitive, cloud-based, and that I can sell anywhere there is an internet connection!","I wish that some of the more premium features were available in the mid-tier solution, particularly integration with FedEx, but for what we pay, we're making do.

I have had to date 4 different stores hosted on the Shopify platform. I keep coming back because of the absolute ease of setting up my stores. Another perk are the various plugin/apps that are available at the click of a button. If you have minimal tech knowledge, you will be able to set-up your store without having to hire anyone. Shopify is a great and easy solution for your e-commerce needs.",Shopify used to provide a 30 free trial and now the changed it to 14 days. I think it takes at least 30 days to get the feel for the platform and learn to navigate it accordingly so it would been great to reinstate those initial 30 day trials.
Digital Marketing Specialist in US,"Business Supplies & Equipment, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,3.0,Good for small businesses,"Overall my experience with Shopify has been good only due to finding out how to customize and change the liquid coding. If it wasn't for Shopify forums or online articles, my online store would not work or function how we need it to be. Shopify also pushes apps that you have to pay for to solve a lot of issues that you will have. It is easy to track orders and send out email notifications, so it has helped us out a lot in the end.","Shopify is great at starting up small businesses or individual sellers in the ecommerce world. I liked how simple it was to setup following all their instructions. I also like the different variety of themes to choose from. Customizing your website is also fairly simple and user friendly, just like the rest of Shopify.","A lot of customizations had to be done to get Shopify to fit our needs. A lot of this is backend work which requires coding. Thankfully the Shopify forums can help out with that, so a beginner can still do it.

Technical Writer in Pakistan,"Information Technology & Services, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify is Good for Big Businesses with monthly sales over $10000,"If you're trying to choose between Shopify and another ecommerce platform, you'll probably be wondering which one to choose. You'll want to look at its price, customization capabilities, Lock-in feature, and support. Shopify is rich in all these.","The Shopify platform has a rich customization option. However, you will have to pay for the extra customization plugins if you want your store to be even more customizable. However, this is an excellent choice if you have a wide variety of products and don't need to customize every aspect of your store. You can also create your own themes if you want. Shopify's customizable checkout experience is secure and optimized.","Pricing for the basic plan of Shopify starts at $9 per month, but goes up to $2k per month if you need more features. In addition to monthly pricing, Shopify also offers an advanced plan that caters to large merchants. The Advanced plan includes custom reports and automation tools. Additionally, the transaction fees are lower than the other Shopify subscription plans. For instance, Shopify charges 2.4% for in-person sales and 0.5% for payments via external gateways. So, it's tough for small merchants to afford."
Business Development Manager in Austria,"Retail, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify - best in class,Overall I only can recommend to use Shopify for an easy and fast setup of your online shop and eCommerce system.,"The most I like about Shopify are the many connectors and integrations available for different well known services. Those are setup at ease and work like a charm.
The second thing I like is that it is a hosted service and very easy and fast to setup - friendly for beginners but advanced enough for experts.
Third there are a lot plugins available for extended customization.","The thing I do not really like is that although there are many things customisable, some things need to be done in programming ways or use plugins at a monthly cost. But from my experience that is the same thing with nearly all shops."

CEO in United Arab Emirates,"Internet, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Is Shopify A Good E-Commerce Platform?,"I have nothing but good experiences to now with Shopify. There have been times when we had to enlist the support team to work through issues, and they were there every time to get things right fast. That is why I still maintain stores on the Shopify platform.","I have used Shopify for some of my e-commerce stores for 18 months and have had a good experience with the platform. It is very easy to set-up and gets to the business of selling quickly. For the new person who is entering the e-commerce online marketing segment, that will help a lot.
Rather than working through the challenges of setting up a website and designing it so it works well, you have a ready solution and can upgrade later as you gain experience with widgets and add-ons that will work seamlessly with the platform and help you sell more.","I do think that over time the costs go up too much for using the platform. Initially, it will not cost much, but as you grow your business, the monthly costs will go up for using the platform and any add-ons that you may use.
This is not really a con in some way since you are going to be earning more. It is something that the entrepreneur needs to be aware of and plan for. As in any business, there is a cost for having the resources you need."

Digital Marketing Manager in US,"Furniture, 201–500 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,"Great potential and possibility, but cannot skip tech spend","Shopify is riding a popularity wave right now which makes integrations plentiful and easy. Their CDN is fast and dependable. If you dedicate a decent development contractor budget, you'll be fine. If you try to do it solely on your own, it is very time consuming.","The interface is easy enough to understand that, even if a programmer has rewritten the entire site in unique liquid code, someone unfamiliar with the platform could verify order information, write blog posts, refund customers, etc. Businesses require collaboration so this is certainly advantageous. Plugins/apps don't crowd the original UI so your main menu will always stay the same. Finally, Shopify is a major, for-profit market force which compels older applications to update to become compatible, and also new entrants elect to work solely with shopify. WooCommerce users demonstrate that they don't want to pay for even basic expenses.
In this way, it separate to two extremes what wordpress tries to meet in the middle. WP has a short, steep learning curve with a lot of interface changes with plugins.","Always another tech language that's used, always another developer required. Customization nearly always requires a developer if its beyond swapping photos or fonts. Products with complex dependent variants do not work past a certain number of options. Limited.
Be very wary of Shopify's app for Google products (ads, tags). These are essential for remarketing and configuration is often better done through coding and google than one of shopify's apps."

Very quick and easy to set up and understand basic e-commerce stores with many templates to choose from, mobile responsiveness, all basic e-commerce features included. Help resources and live support is also top-tier.","Customisations become tricky and quickly become very expensive.

"Management Consulting, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,Great Online Store Builder for Beginners,I will say the first time I used Shopify I was very impressed with how easy it was to work in. I got a call from a friend who runs a non-profit. He had his designer bail on him after saying he would start the project in Shopify. I took at look and after getting into the system it was clear the other designer had done nothing with my buddy's web site. I had never used their system before but the interfaces were very easy to work in and we had his full site created with all of his products (about 30+) listed online and selling by the end of the day. It was pretty sweet to get that knocked out for him and because of that experience I have been using and recommending Shopify to clients where the system fits their needs.,"- Really easy for beginners to build an online store; you can literally build a store in a matter of minutes
- Does not require any coding knowledge
- Excellent interface to work in
- Great built-in tools for working with social media networks
- Fantastic choice if you have a small inventory and are wanting to dip you toe into the e-commerce world cheaply","- Reporting is a bit lack luster for medium to larger businesses
- Inventory tracking is not good if you need more than just quantity on the shelf
- If you have a lot of products and skus it can become hard to manage products; their system is truly targeted to smaller merchants or business owners selling out of their garage
- Does not sync with Desktop accounting software"

This is the single best company I've ever seen that offers so much education and help for FREE. This is very helpful for a small business owner doing everything yourself. 3)thousands of apps available to further the shopify experience and add to your store to do anything possible. 4)cost effective - they offer so much for the most basic plan and you can even pause your subscription whenever you need to","sometimes the apps are not quality made and can slow down your store or not work properly, and sometimes you can't find help on really detailed things that are related to coding/building your site in a customized way. I also don't like that only the first page in your site is drap/drop and easy to create without coding/html experience, and all other pages you add have to be custom coded. This is not easy for 90% of the population who are not web developers. If they can do it for the landing page, they should provide it for any page you want to add to your site.

After all, no system will ever be exactly perfect to your unique business unless you decide to build your own software which comes with the glitches and lack of functionality that building your own software entails.","AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE. Shopify is entirely unparalleled in this regard. Their live chat option is not only convenient but staffed by PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT! They are not an outside tech support and it is clear how well each of them is versed in the system and its capabilities.
Another amazing feature about Shopify is the plethora of apps that are available in order to customize your system (many of which are free!). This means that if Shopify is lacking in any way in terms of your particular business needs, there is definitely an app for it.","1. They dont allow for multiple warehouses/locations in their inventory system!
2. They dont allow for cost of goods (COGs) vs. Retail pricing in their system which means it is completely useless for any inventory management or accounting needs
3. Their inventory system doesn't have an ""inventory taking"" system built in which means it has to be done manually (NOT an option for anyone who has ever had to actually manage an inventory. which i assume is ALL of us)
Overall, their shortcomings are ENTIRELY within the inventory department which is such an essential aspect of running a business and book keeping."
Freelance in Togo,"Marketing & Advertising, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,A complete and very pleasant software to work with,Pleasant user interface and ease of use,"Ofrre a great possibility for beginners. No need for great computer knowledge. Very nice user interface. Well secured and reliable for the customer. The after-sales service is always at the top and available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Payment online and at the point of sale very easy and reliable. The mobile application is still very pleasant and allows you to work anywhere without too much effort. Possibility of having several shops",You have to pay a monthly subscription independent of the sale made. Limitation of personalization of shops. You have to advertise in order to make sales. Low sales traffic at the start of the activity
Product Marketing Manager in US,"Retail, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,No-Brainer For Startups,"Seriously awesome tool for start-ups. A little room for a few improvements, but overall, would definitely recommend.","Great e-comm product. Easy to use, easy to build reports, and if you're looking for a little more customization, it's easy to find the plugin you need. Customer Support was quick and helpful (I should mention that my experience has been with Shopify Plus, that has a chat system). It integrates seamlessly with most platforms.","It started to get a little tricky as we expanded as a business. For one, you can only have one system admin. This became a headache as we had to hunt down the 1 person who could approve a charge, before moving forward with anything. It also got a little trickier to work with as we wanted to move further from ""out of the box"" Shopify set-up. Custom PDPs, etc."
Marketing in France,"Marketing & Advertising, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Shopify review,"My overall experience with Shopify has been excellent. It is an easy to use platform with many features and customization options. We were able to quickly and easily create a store with Shopify and launch our business. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the platform and would recommend it to anyone looking to start a business online.","I like that Shopify is very user-friendly and easy to navigate. It has a lot of features and tools that make it easy to set up and manage an online store. It also has great customer support, which makes it easy to get help when we need it. Lastly, I love the wide variety of themes and customization options that Shopify offers. Shopify allowed us to create << blueside >> ecommerce application. In addition, Shopify offers a wide range of payment options, making it easier for customers to purchase from our store.","The basic plan is quite limited in its features and customisations, and I think Shopify could do more to offer better pricing for those who need more features."
Owner/Designer in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The best place to start for e-commerce,"Overall, I think Shopify is the place to be if you are a small business with an online shop. It's functional, organized, and looks professional to your customers. It's not the most simple to learn, but it's not too complicated and once you figure it out it's smooth sailing.","I love the assurance that the site you build will look good and function well, and the back end capabilities as far as analytics, taxes, shipping, and customer information are totally on point. A great place to start for a new online business","I always wished the site building part was more customizable, I felt it wasn't flexible enough for the styles I wanted. I think the new versions of the Themes (the 2.0's) are a thousand times better, and so it's not really an issue anymore"
Artist in US,"Arts & Crafts, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify won my business.,"10 out of 10. Shopify has exceeded my expectations. From ordering, to questions, to supplier links, they are on their game. I'm honestly impressed.","Not only is this platform quickly becoming the ""cool kid"" in e-commerce, it has features that link you to an array of suppliers. This includes small businesses (i.e. that lil shop in NJ who does amazing giclee prints with a high profit margin!) as well as large. (I.e. printify) The cost per month is low, and if you're just starting out and broke, they don't shut down your store if you can't make that first payment. They simply email a later date they will be processing it. This site is easy to navigate and completely user friendly. Total win.",I would LOVE more unique storefront templates with a cool font selection. That's the artist and marketer in me talking though.
"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,4.0,Solid platform with some odd challenges,"I love the reporting and scalability features of the Shopify platform. It is slightly expensive for a start up so I caution store owners to be careful going all in as the store sales may not support the expense for a while. If you're running a solid store with regular sales, you're in good shape. The apps and marketing channel features make it a great platform to grow a business with.",I love the experience that Shopify has in the field of ecommerce. They have been in the trenches long enough to have covered most of the pressing issues for online store owners. They offer a great variety of apps to enhance the functionality of the store. One of their best features is the use of their shipping account. The pricing is great for your customers and it is simple for you to manage. Shipping calculations have historically been a huge challenge and they have done a good job of addressing that.,"The support is slightly lacking in my opinion. The techs are all polite but too often you are met with a ""we don't support 3rd party themes"" response/brush off. I understand that they shouldn't have to troubleshoot a problem that is the result of a 3rd party or custom theme, they should be able to provide some basic direction on where to look for a solution instead of just referring you back to the developer of the theme. In many cases, we purchase themes from a membership site like Envato and it comes with no support. It's a problem that begs a solution. I'm disappointed in Shopify that they haven't recognized the issue and addressed it in a more proactive manner."
Make-Up Artist in US,"Cosmetics, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is an absolute MUST for e-commerce.,"When I first launched my online store, I used squarespace. After a year, I switched to Shopify because we could easily adjust the shipping fee for the different countries. Plus, Shopify has that connection with FB, Instagram, Pinterest, and Amazon .. you can't beat that.","There are so many things I love about Shopify and their customer service is at the top of the least. They have 24/7 availability to chat live with a representative. As an entrepreneur, sometimes you are working late into the evening (past midnight) and someone is always available to answer your questions! I am floored by this. And if they do not have an answer, the representative will reach out to other employees and email you back with the solution. Excellent service.","There isn't much I don't love about Shopify. They connect with FB and instagram and sell on those platforms, they provide excellent analytics, easy information for shipping internationally, and many templates and apps to help elevate your business."
"Graphic Design Software, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,The perfect E-commerce solution.,Overall experience has been very good. We have launched upwards of 20 sites since we began using this software. We have migrated some sites away from big commerce and woocommerce and our clients have been really happy with the switch.,Not having to build out ecommerce stores from scratch help us a great deal and allow us quickly get our clients sites deployed with minimal setup once design is approved.,The only con I would say would be that there are so many extras that have to be purchased on top of the basic cost in the form of apps. I understand there are certain implementations that require the extra cost I just wish more of the basics would be included.
Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,I should have switched to Shopify sooner!,"Shopify customer service is pretty amazing. They are knowledgeable and easily help you with anything site related. Customer service is not quick to get you off the phone, they truly seem like they want to help me succeed and even offer up suggestions on things I didnt know about for my store...I feel like each time I have had the need to contact customer service, not only do they resolve whatever issue I was having, they leave me with even more knowledge so I can excel my website. I've only had one issue that was unpleasant and that was when Shopify resynced my products to google. I was getting really good traffic and when they did the resync, all my sessions dropped to maybe 15-20 per day. Im still recovering from that because I was doing about 500 sessions per day before they did the resync. Wish they would have told me it would cause a pause in sessions because it turned out the products were already synced with google and live on the shopping ad I have running but for some reason these products showed as pending on the shopify side. They really didnt do much to check into that before doing the resync so this is quite frustrating that I lost my momentum with google.",Anyone can create a great looking website with little effort or knowledge about building websites. A little bit of a learning curve but after that I found Shopify to be quite easy to use.,I really dont understand the need for all the apps. It forces you to have to speak with third parties when issues arise with the apps. I feel the majority of the apps offer features that should already be integrated within Shopify but since the apps I've needed are free (for now) Im ok with this. I know big commerce uses apps too.
Software Engineer in Sri Lanka,"Education Management, 10,000+ Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The Best E-commerce Platform,"we recommend Shopify as the first choice for e-commerce sites. As it has tons of features, extremely easy to use, fast, secure, and much more. This is the reason why most big brands like the New York Times Shop, Penguin Books, Red Bull, and even Tesla uses Shopify for their e-commerce websites.","Secure: Most of the people might prefer Shopify for their e-commerce store or website because it ensures the safety of their platform. As many of these stores have to deal with the credit cards, so they cannot go for self-hosting.
Fast and easy to use: Using Shopify means less loading time for your web pages, which also means faster means of business. Plus Shopify handles your PCI compliance as well. Moreover, you have easy access to all your business aspects whether it is sending/receiving payments or customizing your store, Shopify has it all.","Charges: Shopify comes with all these amazing features but none of it comes for free. You will have to pay a decent amount for that. Besides the monthly fee, you will have to pay a transaction fee if your buying or selling something to a third party. Other than that, you will have to pay if you install any app.
Marketing: If you are used to working on Wordpress, then Shopify is not the kind of site you'll like. Shopify does not have a good solution for the content marketing of blogs."

With Shopify you have much more than half of the work already done and well-armed, so you can dedicate yourself to what really matters, marketing and selling","The only bad thing that I find with Shopify is that you get to a point with respect to customization, so if you have created a very specific e-commerce store specialized in some branch, it will cost you to take it to the maximum customization"

It is fast and easy to set up and starts selling immediately.
The feature I like the most though is Email Marketing! You can send unlimited marketing(conservatively) emails to your email list over the course of your subscription on any plan. This will give you an edge to get your customers to visit your store.",I have no real complaints with Shopify really. It is the best eCommerce store builder out there in the market. What it lacks in in-built features you can get with its integration with third-party services using Zapier.
Artisan/Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Great for Larger Businesses - Not for Smaller,"Shopify is still a software that I would revisit if I were to grow beyond what I can handle with my Etsy and Square current combination. Shopify has a lot of positive things to it that I can see would be incredibly useful to larger companies, but after over a year of using the software for eCommerce, it wasn't working for my incredibly small business. ROI just wasn't there - more because, I'm sure, I wasn't taking advantage of some of the features because I frankly couldn't handle the expense. If you've got more of a budget for eCommerce, advertising, and website management, this is a great piece of SaaS.","The flexibility to create/control my entire website was nice. There are quite a few functions that are absolutely critical to successful retail, like coupons, abandoned carts, etc. It's great for having multiple brands as well, as you can indicate which brand is attached to which item if needed.","You need to add apps for almost everything. I spent more time managing my website than I did creating new items while I was using Shopify, and I got little to no return on it. There are apps for importing items from other sites (like Etsy), apps for mailing lists, apps for just about everything you can name. Most of them cost - so there is more to the cost of Shopify than the monthly fees."
owner in Canada,"Arts & Crafts, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Easy to set up and maintain,"As a small business owner, I like that I can go in and edit and maintain my website myself. I have complete control (within the limitations of the theme) to go in and edit or add listings. I was able to migrate my Etsy listings over to our Shopify website and then just go in and tweak them a bit, which saved me a lot of time and energy. There is a learning curve, as with anything, but I find it fairly intuitive and easy to use.","I like that it's fairly intuitive and there are so many apps that integrate well with Shopify. The price point is fair, and I'm able to build and maintain my e-comm website myself.","I can't really think of anything that has come up that I didn't like. I'm currently using a free theme, which has limitations, but there are paid themes that you can get to suit your business."

To app plug ins that help with fraud, and tracking analytics.","The best parts about this software are the fact that anyone can use it. Even people who are not well versed in E-commerce.
It is fantastic for stores of all sizes, and now it can manage multiple warehouses.
I love the support we get with Shopify PLUS, and every time I have issues or am looking for app solutions they point me in the right direction.","My associates get confused when the UX updates piece by piece, I personally do not mind it, but day to day as they do updates it can look different, and I need to explain to them this is how you would update a large platform like this."
Project Management in US,"Computer & Network Security, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Great application to get started.,"Overall, my experience with Shopify has been very positive. It is a reliable and feature-rich platform that has helped me easily set up and manage my online store. While it may be more expensive than some other options, I feel that the additional features and customer support make it worth the cost.","Shopify is a very user-friendly e-commerce platform that allows users to easily set up and manage an online store.

Its very useful for startups as withing few weeks you have a store ready and you can goto market faster than other solutions.,"Shopify is a SaaS ( Software as a Service ) and is very easy to use. Customizing is easy with liquid templating engine. Plugins economy is robust and helps you in providing new features in minutes. Also they manage the infrastructure so user need not worry about hosting.
Even a complex system like multivendor marketplace can be installed and setup in a day max.","As its SaaS service, you dont control the software, so you cant go to some other service provider. You are captive.
Shopify dont give you control of checkout pages in lower plans. So you have to use what is available."
Business Owner in US,"Entertainment, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,Great Platform for a Top Price!,"It has been a good but slow experience with Shopify. On Wix, I can work with many graphics and they offer the videomaking feature but on Shopify, I have to import files from outside sources. For example, I can't create a video on Shopify to upload onto my website. Instead, I have to create a video on Vimeo or Wix and then bring in the .mov file to upload onto Shopify to promote the products on sale. It's been a great team effort and it has made my life during the pandemic more fun and exciting. I hope Shopify generates a lot of sales as soon as possible.","I like how I redesign my website, and there are a lot of simple, straightforward designs to choose from. It is easy to upload photos of my products onto the platform and I pay a pretty low subscription fee for about $29 each month to keep the domain. I created Shopify during the pandemic because my Wix website was not bringing in a lot of traffic into the website and I wasn't making sales, but Shopify is a better choice to sell products and promote products than Wix.",I don't like paying the subscription price on Shopify because it is too simple for the cost I have to pay to maintain the domain. I wish there was a way to keep the domain and pay only $29 a month for everything. I had a freelancer help me connect all of the SEO keywords to my Shopify account to make sure I receive traffic from customers because the purpose of my service is to bring in new customers and subscribers.

We love to hear that ""Ching"" that happens on the app as sales come in!","Shopify made it extremely easy for us to setup and manage our online store! We were setup and ready to go within a day, and that's with extreme customization added! We would have been good to go on the first day if we wanted to just put up some products for sale and promote them!",The only thing we could complain about is the price point and that it would be better if they had some sort of non-profit discounts.
Founder in US,"Health, Wellness & Fitness, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is revolutionary,I have been using Shopify for over 3 years now and I have started so many stores using its platform. There are apps for almost every feature you'd like on your website. It is one of my top Ecomerce apps to use.,I love that Shopify is makes building a website very easy and simple. You can basically set up and launch an online store the same day versus other competitors which have a greater learning curve and may require you to hire a developer.,"Shopify being simple and easy to operate comes with a disadvantage. The websites are not as customizable. So, you'd have to pick a theme that is close to what you are looking for or find someone who can code using Shopify's liquid language."

I have had a good experience with this platform,"With Shopify, you can choose from thousands of online store templates that will give your online store it professional look and feel. Payments are secured and handle very discreetly giving you and your potential buyers peace of mind. Shopify integrates well with the mobile application and is optimized for users on mobile as well as desktop screens. Safe and secure back-up of all your transactional data as well your website data can be initiated with a few easy steps unlike competitive software that relies heavily on plugins Shopify breaks it down so that the website owner needs minimal coding knowledge to get around the important aspects.",In some instances adding advanced features etc. onto a specific template can be daunting if you're looking at a high level of customization that is not necessarily supported by the theme itself you can be confronted with some higher-level CSS and custom HTML coding to make additional features work well. I would love to see a free plan on Shopify especially for users that want to familiarize themselves beyond the free-trial period that Shopify has on offer when you initially sign up or show interest.

We are able to efficiently migrate from Bigcommerce and also the 2nd store from woocommerce
Overall integrations with shipping software, tax software, or ERP have been fairly simple due to multiple ready-to-use connectors.
Migration from other platforms is very easy, we utilized 2 different services - LiteExtension and Cart2Cart, Both allowed redirects to be setup which are critical for SEO.","Everything is app-based, any additional features you require will have associated app costs. Some basic things like product dimensions per item are not available and have to be done with apps.
Some integrations may not be available and these would have to be done using custom-developed connectors or API."
Ecomm Director in US,"Consumer Goods, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is a must have for ecomm businesses small and large.,"Shopify has been great, the only times there are issues are when it is not built to do something. For example, you cannot apply a coupon code in a cart, and the apps existing for it do not work well--other platforms allow this easier. But Shopify simply wasn't built with that in mind.","Shopify is out of the box useful with amazing core features and easy to customize layouts. It only expands as you become an expert and install more apps. It's fluid, functional, and a great experience. It is also easy to manage deployments of code, as well as schedule changes for different days and managing inventory closely.","It does cost more when you do more, for example to be able to truly run it right, you do need Shopify+."
"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,4.0,A pretty good option for a small business!,"Overall, Shopify has made it simple to showcase and sell our product to customers all over the world. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone considering opening a small business.","As an employee of a (very) small business--just me and one other full-time employee, and a handful of part-time folks--I was so relieved to find an e-retail option that had just the right amount of functionality. We only offer a couple hundred products, so we didn't need something exhaustive. And because a number of our employees were part-time, we needed something with a low bar for entry. We found it! It's Shopify.
Shopify makes it easy to add, edit, and update product pages, giving our online store a sleek and simple look that's easy to navigate. It also has a ton of handy guides for updating your site and ecommerce tips overall. I learned so much from their features on social media!","Every once in a while, it's difficult to format a page in the way that we want. Our landing page was especially difficult, and we had to rotate through a couple template options before we found one that worked for our industry.
We sometimes feel that Shopify wasn't especially geared for our inventory processing needs, though it would be much simpler for someone who was only selling a couple kinds of products."
Co-Founder & COO in US,,Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Great service but you need to be careful,We saved a lot of time and money to build our own website. Most importantly we can be assured by the stable service.,"1. Easy to use and hassle free. Analytics is super helpful.
2. There are some learning curves but it is easy to get accustomed.
Shopify constantly add up new features like social network integrations, new sales channels, added security and so on.
3. A lot of Apps to try although it is the double-edged sword. It is easy to determine which app you will pick based on a lot of reviews compared to different platforms.
4. Their default payment system - Stripe is very easy to set up. PayPal and Amazon Payment integrations are also very easy to set up.
5. Facebook, Pinterest and Instagram shopping integration is awesome. It is really helpful either send more customers to your website or real sales on those platforms.
6. Amazon and eBay integrations are not that great but worth to try.","Apps, Apps, Apps. If you want to add up some features that means you have to pay the extra money and also you might need to sacrifice your site's speed because of the added codes from Apps. Not every App but some Apps will definitely drag your site's speed. Uninstalling Apps are easy but there might be some residues from uninstalled Apps. That is annoying sometimes."

I find it ideal for startups beginning their journey and business that want to go online with very low investment needed. It has also a wide ecosystem of plugins that you and add for the non out of the box functionalities, a lot of them for free and really easy to install and configure. Also one thing to remark is that you don't need to worry about hosting or capability as you scale the business as they take care of all of that + CDN for best perfomance. Also it has a more professional suite just in case you need more support.","The 2 most deceiving facts about Shopify for me is when you go international as it does not support multicurrency or different stores by country sharing stock (you need to create a different shopify for all of them)., that sometimes impact conversion as even if you are capable of doing some tweaks to show different currencies you can only transact in on, same happening with the localization of the site, which is not good for SEO purposes. the second thing is the fact that you cannot customize the checkout funnel, that provides the system to be more stable btu does not allow you to do A/B testing and improve conversion on checkout."

I like the hassle-free secure checkout built in, with Shopify taking the compliance responsibility. I like the availability of different themes and apps for customizing to a store's needs","With the secure checkout comes the unfortunate lack of customization of the checkout process during and after the sale, which blocks the ability to add sales-growing features there."

If someone from other countries uses Shopify I can say it's the best option available in the market, we are really happy.","It's easy, no need to have great programming education, it also have many other plug ins or external apps to help the store to function as we need.","Some templates and apps are a real scam, doesn't really work and Shopify support can't do anything about it because they didn't develop them. The same happens with Wordpress sometimes.
But, the real thing that I like the least is that the payment options are limited because we are in Latin America (Central America) and not all options are available in our country."

If the online store being built doesn't have a lot of advanced or specific requests, Shopify is great as I can easily guide my clients on administering their store on their own once it has been built. All in all, I do not have to worry about setting up a server to get the best performance and SEO for my stores as Shopify does those automatically. For clients that are not very tech savvy, Shopify is the best bet.","For beginners, Shopify is very easy to get started. One can almost immediately start adding products and get their store live within 30 mins. The best thing about Shopify is the way it automatically scales the resources according to the number of visitors, I do not have to worry about messing/upgrading the server resources to make sure that my store doesn't crash. Another huge convenience is the payment processing options that I can choose from.","Shopify doesn't have a lot of product customizing options, and it can be a hassle to display your products the way that I want on my store. Also, Shopify takes a cut of the revenue and when I'm building stores with low profit margins, I'd rather build the store on WooCommerce which is better in the long term. Moreover, if Shopify could implement some kind of regional pricing for developing countries, it would be great."

This system, which is considered one of the best and most popular systems in the field of e-commerce. At a time when we see the worlds of technology dominating our lives, it is no longer possible for anyone to live without contact with these worlds. Especially in the field of e-commerce, this commerce has become an integral part of our daily lives. Therefore, it became necessary for us to be familiar with it in all its aspects. So I decided to share with you my experience with the Shopify platform, the Shopify system was founded in 2004, and since then it is considered one of the best systems specialized in e-commerce. At a time when this system is spread over more than 170 countries around the world. Many professionals in this field also see that the Shopify platform is very similar to the WordPress platform. However, the former specializes in e-commerce only. This platform is based on creating your own online store. After that it allows you to sell everything you want through this store. Such as (clothes, electronic devices, household items, cosmetics, cars, and many more). In short, you can use the Shopify platform in order to sell anything","Easy to use and does not require any technical skills from the user. Shopify is ready for anything you may throw away. You can sell goods rechargeable, digital products, services, anything. Shopify gives you a wide range of designs store.","If you want to enable your customers to leave reviews and ratings for your products, these features are additional paid through additions. You're not exactly in full control of your store. It is hosted on store servers owned by Shopify. This means that if they decide, at any time, cancel your store, so they can."

More advanced than other platforms we have used in the past and also along side,"It’s really easy to use l, when we started selling physical products our wix site didn’t offer the functions that we needed. Shopify offered the more complicated end of e-commerce like personal discount vouchers and shop cart reminders. The little things that really bring a small business into an organised marketing platform.","It’s expensive, it costs more and we struggled to have it as our standard website as wix offered more in different departments. It wasn’t as easy as other platforms to me to get started and we had issues with certain categories in the shop which were eventually helped by the customer service team. It’s expense though, it’s worth it but I begrudgingly dislike the price."

Set yourself up for success with their knowledge on e-commerce, templates, and built in features that make this product work out of the box. You can be selling in less than an hour if you have all of your documentation and products ready to go.","Some features are limited and only work with Shop Pay, which they have a reason to push that, but overall integration with other payment types to include local delivery or document management would be nice."

At times, Shopify can get pretty pricey when adding in all the integrated apps. Overall, we are happy with the platform.",Shopify is one of the largest platforms for hosting your eCommerce store. There are hundreds of apps that integrate with the store to customize to every need.,"Although you have the ease to integrate several apps to your store, these monthly costs and subscriptions add up rather quickly and can be costly on a monthly basis vs a Word Press website. These apps can also cause issues, so troubleshooting can go back and forth between the app itself and Shopify customer service."
SENIOR IT MANAGER in Ghana,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify is the best ecommerce platform,"As far as am concern, ever since I moved my store to shopify, I've not encountered any glitches. My sales went up due to their inbuilt SEO features which drives me more traffic naturally.","Shopify is a great place to start! Whether you are a small seller with a few items, or a huge company, It has everything you need to have a successful online store.
Shopify is arguable the most popular platform for creating unique online stores.
My number one reason for choosing shopify over other platform is their security and up-time
Ever since i started using shopify I've never encountered any cyber security issues with them.
The platform has a wide variety of themes which some are free and paid version. The themes are very easy to edit due to the drag and drop feature which was introduced not long ago.
They platform also has lot of apps which you can use to extend the features of your store.
In all I chose shopify over WordPress' woocommerce after trying my store on both platforms","I have one major problem with the shopify platform. You can't set up complex shipping rules without paying additional money or upgrading to a higher plan. Even that you still need to pay for a shipping app from third parties to be able to achieve that.
Secondly the admin dashboard is quiet slow when you are making changes to your store."
Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Shopify for Online Resellers,Overall Shopify is a great value for the money. The basic fee pays for a nice website with many customizable features. I appreciate how well they work with some of my existing programs while there is still room for more to come.,I joined Shopify for the seamless integration with ConsignCloud. I love that my inventory can be listed in ConsignCloud and immediately dispursed to several platforms and my website via Shopify. There are many free features to integrate with.,I am extremely disappointed about the discontinuation of the Ebay app through Shopify. This used to work great and was a HUGE part of my business. The most useful app integrations are additional monthly fees. Shipping calculations can only be made with one box size. My products are all different sizes and this is extremely hard for shipping.

It provides you with hundreds of free and paid templates to use when building your store.
It offers you help 24 hours a day, seven days a week, as well as four global phone numbers to reach him directly.
Working inside him is made much more enjoyable by the fact that you may contact with him via chat or email.
It is a platform that has millions of investors around the world, including international investors, trusting it, thus it is completely safe.
It offers you simple and easy payment options while still safeguarding your personal information.","In truth, these are not negatives; rather, they are the financial recompense that Shopify will demand in exchange for many of the benefits it provides.
Each department's commission varies, but we can assume that a commission of no more than 3% on every $100 will be quite satisfactory for both parties.
And if you look at it from another angle, you'll see that by paying them a commission, you get continuous support and hosting, as well as the ability to keep your mind clear and away from technical issues, which if your interface is outside the Shopify domain, you'll have to rely on programmers, who may or may not be up to the level of trust you place in them, so you lose."
Co Editor Chief in Venezuela,"Marketing & Advertising, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,The best option in the market for e-commerce.,"I have had an experience that has exceeded my expectations. By hiring their services, you receive a very intuitive platform that offers everything imaginable so that your business can be at the same level as the existing large brands. I really like that I can work with a team without geographical limitations thanks to the Shopify platform. I have saved a lot of time in the programming, they offer you many options in their templates so you can build your store with the details that you like, it is a great experience.","It seems fantastic to have in one place, everything you need for electronic commerce, I have a year of use for the people who work and it is great all the benefits it offers. You can, in a few minutes, upload a product for sale completing everything that your intuitive interface is requesting, then you can, within the same platform, use the SEO service to position your products in browsers, it's a wonder, , you can immediately post any products on social networks. I have worked with other platforms and none compare with Shopify. It has everything you need to succeed in digital entrepreneurship. Another important element in e-commerce is the analysis of statistics, with Shopify you have just one click, you can see the origin of web traffic and know from which electronic device people access your store.","The benefits offered by Shopify are greater than the negative aspects, so I do not identify problems when implementing it. They include constant improvements, so you can be sure that any possible inconvenience will be resolved in record time as we are accustomed to your customers."

"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,Consistent,We are happy to use Shopify and feel comfortable with what it has to offer for our business.,"Shopify has maintained a fairly constant and consistent set up for a while now and while that can feel frustrating, they have done a good job at keeping what they do have functional and helpful. Apps allow further customization and allow for some unique options and they are good at helping out when there are issues with my store, fairly rare, but when needed it's important. Customers are used to using Shopify as it has become a standard for online shopping.",I wish they would rely less on Apps sometimes as that can quickly increase the fees my shops ends up paying every month.
Systems Engineer in US,"Automotive, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,"Fast, straighforward, and functional software to lauch an eCommerce store","I have had an excellent experience with Shopify. Straightforward billing that doesn't nickel and dime you. They have very little downtime and anytime there are issues, they are quick to resolve them. We are using Shopify for a new product line we launched several years ago. We didn't want to use our existing platform as it was too cumbersome and was setup to sell a fairly different product line. Once we decided on Shopify we were able to have our new product line launched within a month all while starting from scratch. We also like the ability to connect and sell our product on other channels such as amazon and eBay.",The best features of Shopify is how easy it is to get an eCommerce store up and running. They walk you through the steps to get launched. Everything is simple. They have many free and paid website templates to select from and you don't need to know how to code to have a great looking website. They also have many 3rd party apps available to solve most of the features that are lacking in the main Shopify backoffice.,The biggest downside to Shopify is that they make it so straightforward and easy to use that it can lack some more advanced or specific features that we would like. The good news is that they have a 3rd party app store that has plenty of apps to fill all the missing features we have desired.
Small Business Owner in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Excellent for an e-commerce shop for small businesses or those who don’t know anything about coding,,,
"Marketing & Advertising, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,Reviewer Source,5.0,Shopify As A Platform For Creatives,"One of the things that I absolutely love about Shopify is their top-notch customer service. Each and every time I had questions, I would use the chat function. Every representative would patiently walk me through step by step in order to resolve any issues or answer any questions that I had. I was always made to feel welcome.","As a creative, I find Shopify to be a great platform to sell designs and merch. With the IG and FB integration, it enables me to automatically market on both platforms without having to download and upload to both feeds.
The free templates that are provided are easy to configure and thus allow one to get started quickly without the need for a developer. (I do have a web design background so that may be a bias on my part).
Lastly, I really appreciate the Paypal function. For those of us who use POD, our credit cards are charged as soon as a customer places an order. This facilitates the printing and shipping process. After a 3-5 day period, we then receive funds from the customer's credit card. Honestly, I do not like having my credit card charged each and every time. Plus, I got into POD for its seamlessness. The PayPal function automatically sends the funds to the printer and I receive my profit after all deductions have taken place. THAT is a WIN-WIN.","One of the things that I found to be frustrating is the inability to combine promo offers such as ""25% off and free shipping over $40"". In my experience, it has been either one or the other unless I wanted to pay for a monthly app.
Another thing is that I found the trial period of 15 days to be a little short. If you think about it, there are multiple steps in getting a store up and running let alone advertising, etc. For a newcomer, this is daunting. I would have been more comfortable and appreciative if I had 20 days instead of 15 as I felt pressured and actually made some mistakes in the process."
Account Manager in UK,"Wholesale, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,A Fantastic platform to manage ecommerce easily for all levels,Perfect platform to familiarise yourself with the world of ecommerce.,"Having run ecommerce shops on various platforms, Shopify is by far the easiest to set up and run. It is ideal for all levels of ability, requiring no programming knowledge to get going. It is ideal for either solo use or within a team, so anyone can get going and quickly too.
The platform itself guides you through the set up, enabling you to create a basic shop design quickly and offers numerous templates, third party plugins and the ability to track those all important sales.
If you are interested in starting a basic ecommerce system then it is a great platform to start your journey with and comes at affordable pricing too.","As your shop grows, so does the likelihood of using additional plugins and the want to customise your shop further. These come with additional monthly costs and this is where things start to ramp up.
If you feel the need to customise your shop further to fit in with your unique branding and want the ability to offer some unique pages, you will need knowledge of coding and still this may present a challenge. Shopify is perfect for those who are not tech savvy and are wanting to create a small ecommerce shop. However, for a bigger businesses it is not quite there yet.
Lastly, customer service is sometimes questionable with the help received. It pays to read around and do your research rather than bank solely on their support."

Shopify is intuitive and easy to use. I have tried competitors but Shopify beats all in terms of functionality and features.","It is more expensive than competitors. I wish there were more features that came native with the plan, like drag and drop theme templates - this is now standard in the website design industry and it's disappointing that you have to pay extra for an app or theme to do this."
Team Member in UK,"Hospitality, 501–1,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify Until Your Heart's Content!,"If there was one platform I needed that was user friendly for myself or clients, then building an eCommerce store with Shopify would have to be it. I've spent a huge amount of time and money building eCommerce stores in the past, but the way Shopify intergrates easily with daily essentials just works wonders. I would highly recommend giving Shopify a trial run and you won't regret it.","The add-ons have to be probably the biggest advantage. They are more or less plug 'n' play which really helps from a development perspective since they intergrate with the platform very easily. This is a huge time and cost saver, compared to having a programmer / coder build certain features from scratch. It very flexible in customisation and I'm honestly very impressed with what this is capable of.","For new start-ups, the add-ons do build up the production and runnings costs and I honestly think that a number of add-ons are essential, so this is a downside, yet, it's an important asset when it comes to building a profitable eCommerce business."

-it's fairly cheap
-The learning curve is quick. No need to learn to code.
-It's pretty much fully integrated with all the apps/add-ons/web page themes that you can think of
you can create your own professional-looking and fully functional online store extremely quickly and for the fraction of the cost of getting a custom website made by a web developer.","Unless you pay for upgraded website themes, most other web stores are going to run the same theme as yours."

Sr. Data Analyst in US,"Education Management, 501–1,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,An extremely powerful and easy to use e-commerce platform,Ease of use and endless opportunity.,"Shopify has been providing a very easy to use and powerful SaaS e-commerce platform for years. I can't even imagine using a non-SaaS shopping cart these days and Shopify is my go to product - even for sites that don't sell anything - purely for the ease of use of the content management (blog, pages). With a massive amount of site themes and 3rd party add-on apps, so much is possible. And, with help from a knowledgeable programmer, you can really make Shopify do anything with it's native language, Liquid. I think the real defining moment with Shopify for me that continues to happen is when I turn a less technical client onto Shopify and they don't call me for help because they intuitively figured it out. That alone is a massive accomplishment. But, I love all the other very thoughtfully engineered things like automatically connecting to GoDaddy to setup a domain.","There are some limitations in terms implementing more complex catalogs or functionalities that often will require a 3rd party app. An example might be very complex business rules for shipping in terms of multiple products that require multiple boxes, etc."
Marketing manager in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shop and ship with Shopify!,"I love this app, once again the future of technology has changed so much and made lives so much easier, especially for someone with anxiety like myself. I can imagine the benefits that this app would be for someone with OCD as well, just being able to constantly check the program on the progress of shipping and finding discounts and knowing exactly where your items are and when you will receive them without looking at a dozen different windows being opened of separate apps for each carrier. It’s definitely one of those things I’d call a lifesaver even if it’s not as important to someone else. It has made my life easier that’s for sure.",I love that all my purchases and the packages being sent to me as well are in one app instead of me having to open and close several apps/websites to see my orders and things being shipped out or to myself,Sometimes this app does not update as fast as other apps but it’s not enough of a problem for me to discontinue use.

Co-Founder | Creative Director in Canada,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Easiest eCommerce platform to get you up & running fast,"We use, manage, and develop Shopify sites for many of our agency clients from a number of different industries. Our clients' love Shopify's ease of use for processing orders, while we often fight with the customization limits.","Shopify is without a doubt the easiest eCommerce platform available in terms of getting your shop up and running quickly. With a ton of free themes and plugins, even light, non-tech savvy users will be able to get their products online within a couple of days.
Shopify's support is also A1, with live chat, phone and email options available, they were always very quick to respond to messages, and even in cases where the issue was escalated to a developer, queries were responded to and fixed within 24hrs!","The major issue with Shopify is in 2 parts; Cost, and Customization.
Due to its' ease of use, Shopify is a bit of a pain to customize. You'll find that in order to do anything above extremely basic eCommerce functions, you'll need to start stringing together a variety of plugins to get the job done properly. Most, if not all of these plugins will come at a cost, which is a recurring monthly fee. After a couple plugins, it's not unheard of to be paying upwards of $300/mo. just to get the base functionality you need.
Furthermore, if you want to make any huge edits to the site's design or functionality, you'll quickly learn that the ceiling for customization is pretty low. You'll often be faced with ""This is going to be way too complex to do a simple change"" or ""This is simply not possible with Shopify""."

CTO in Venezuela,"Computer Software, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,The best is yet to come,"Blazing fast developments, more customers, more earnings","Shopify is a platform focused on product and inventory managment for your online sales. It allows you to tack your inventory and have reports on your sales. You might say ""well, others can do that as well"" and the answer is yes, but can they do it better? Shopify is a software as a service, self hosted with a monthly pament. For setting up a quick shop for someone not tech saavy at all Shopify is perfetc, just a few clicks and you're earning money. If you have a physical store the POS is free! Customer service people is always happy and gentle.","Lack of customization for the product structure at the development level. You end up doing ""tricks"" with tags and tables inside the content of the product to do some cutomizations at template level. Customer service is a fallacy, yes, they have a chat and they talk with you but 3/3 times I've used it they said my problem was going to be resolved later, that they would open a ticket for that and they never happened (I had to open again a chat in order for them to remind my case). Layout of the admin sections is not clear enough, many links and sections are hidden in undescriptive links."
Owner in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Great Platform for business,Shopify has been great since we started with them years ago. The gurus are amazing and they go out of their way to help solve your problems. I highly recommend Shopify to businesses looking for a great online store presence for their business.,"The setup process such as adding products, sizes and quantities was easy. Many store designs to choose from and you can add your own touch.",Some of the apps are a little pricey and the apps can add up really quickly each month. This will cause your Shopify bill to be higher. Adding apps associated with a price may not be ideal for new businesses or businesses that’s not generating income.
Chief Operating Officer in US,"Military, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,SHOPIFY FLEXIBIITY FOR THE MOBILE MERCHANT,"The Shopfiy system continues to impress us daily as we continue to find new features or they update the software with new features that make our retail management easier. The system is continually in a spiral development and I assume adapts to client provided feedback. The latest function we found that impressed us is the ability to utilize our mobile phones to scan a bar code on a product when processing a transaction and have it added to the cart of the client. We have bar code scanners that we use, but this was a nice backup feature in case our bar code scanner is not working and we are at a remote event site away for replacement bar code scanners.","Utilizing Shopfiy for our retail management has been an incredibly wise decision for our business model. We operate both an online store but also an in store retail operations as well as a mobile retail when attending events. Shopify's flexibility to meet all three of these requirements has been second to none. The system has allowed us to have more frequent promotional sales, highlight retail items for special pricing for inventory clearance, and allows for special discounts. The inventory management capability has allowed for much more accurate inventory monitoring and reordering of retail items. This list of things we like most goes on and on.","The only thing that would be a draw back is our monthly cost of this software. We receive a non-profit discount for the monthly cost, but a lower cost would always be beneficial for the organization as well as lower processing fees, but their fees are pretty much industry average."
"Airlines/Aviation, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,Reviewer Source,5.0,Best for automating business sales,The CMS is robust and reliable. It is easy to use despite being expensive.,"Shopify connects to most software to automate admin tasks like fulfilment, followup emails and service emails. The app store has great features and is easy to install.","Price. The fees are high compared to other CMS' monthly charges. Not only that, they take transaction fees as well.
Unfair. Even if there is fraud, Shopify will take the customer's side and penalise you."
"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,Started my online boutique with Shopify!,"Overall, I've had nothing but a great experience. I cannot get over how nice their customer service reps are. When talking on the phone with them, they truly want to help you and they honestly feel like a friend helping you out. Great company!","My favorite part about Shopify is how easy it is to create a beautiful website and keep track of inventory! I started with a very basic website and ended up purchasing a theme about a year later and it completely changed the look of my whole website! I was very happy with how easy it was to set-up. Entering in new inventory is a breeze and now that you are able to enter in the ""cost"" of a product, it is even better to help with tracking profits. Also, I have to add that the customer service is AMAZING! They are always so helpful and always solve any problem I may have. Overall, Shopify is great for small business owners and I would recommend to anyone searching for a platform to use.","Shopify is great! But one thing I would suggest improving is the transition of implementing a new theme for your site. Most of your content doesn’t automatically reformat. But once you change everything, you are good to go!"

Managing Partner in US,"Internet, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify Review,I've worked with a lot of clients over the years using Shopify and find that for most clients it is the best overall solution based on price and ease of use.,Shopify is easy to setup and get started quickly. A big positive is that you don't have to already have a credit card processor as Shopify will handle that for you and is reasonably priced. Another plus is that in just a few hours or less you can have a full blown online store up and running that is professional quality. I've been involved in Shopify both as a developer/reseller and a user so have seen both sides.,Product attributes needs some work as it is a little clunky and difficult to style and setup if you have complex needs (such as selling customized products). Some of the better features (like having full customization control over the checkout page) are only available on the most expensive plan (Shopify Plus) which is well over 2k a month in hosting fee. Other necessary functions integral to more customization controls can only be made possible by purchasing third party plugins that have monthly fees.
Head Of Operations in Pakistan,Research,Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify makes you manage and create your own store easily,"I have benefited a lo from Shopify. Shopify has surely helped me in running my online business. I haven't earned much yet through this platform because I feel I'm still new to this online realm. I have more online presence with an increasing customer base. I can sell my products easily without any hassle. The return I am getting from just a small investment in this portal, this is just astonishing. As everything is online, I don't have to give this business a lot of attention as I know it still keeps on running without my intervention. The analysis feature helps a lot in marketing my product to the right market further bringing in more income for me.

CEO in US,"Fine Art, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,"Easy to deploy, affordable and highly customizable","Shopify is simple to set up and navigate while also allowing for more complex integrations.

Some of the features that I found most impactful are website management, mobile access, order management, inventory management, multi-channel marketing, and customizable branding.Shopify is straightforward to use, and it provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to manage all aspects of their online store easily. It also provides various integrations with third-party apps and services, making it easier for users to integrate with their existing business processes.","While Shopify is an excellent e-commerce platform, I find it slightly expensive compared to other e-commerce solutions available in the market.Overall, Shopify is an easy-to-use platform, but some advanced features may require some technical expertise or training to use efficiently."
"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,3.0,Easy and secure Ecommerce platform,"Shopify is a great way to get started in Ecommerce. It has payment options with Stripe and PP, works well and securely and is great for selling physical goods. I think its more complicated to use now, and if you want to sell on Google and FB channels you need to make sure you comply with all their merchant t&c's.",Shopify is an affordable and easy step into Ecommerce for many new vendors. It offers people an easy way to sell things online. It's not terribly difficult to master the software and there are tons of themes and apps available on the platform.,"Shopify is slowly becoming more suited to bigger sellers, and less suited to startups or one-man shops. More knowledge is required to set up and maintain stores than before. Interfaces and apps with Facebook and Google have changed now making them more complicated. Shopify will say it benefits the sellers but I don't see that - I think it meets the needs of Facebook and Google more. It seems Shopify are more focused on FB and Google channels and adding a fulfilment channel to their business."

The ability to customise close to anything (now also including the check out) makes it a no-brainer for close to all companies looking for an ecommerce solution","The ability to not offer several currencies out of the box is a problem.

CEO in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Almost perfect E-commerce platform,Overall it’s a great platform.,"Shopify is easy to learn and use, and makes getting an E-commerce platform up pretty simple.
Pros:
- Easy product uploading
- Easy to install themes
- Seo settings work well","My biggest con with Shopify is not being able to change the checkout sequence.
There are way too many steps between the cart and the checkout. The more times someone has to click next or fill out more fields the less likely thy are to complete the checkout (that’s proven). There is no option to change this unless you have the enterprise plan for around $15,000."

We had developers set up the site, but we are able to make a lot of the day to day changes and reach out to developers for the more complicated things.",It has lots of plugins available so the features and functionality seem pretty broad. I also like how a lot of maintenance can be done without a developer.,"I do wish more features were native or free. They seem to know that there are a lot of third party apps that will provide services customers need, but that adds up. I wish somethings were included in the base package and not just via upgrade to Pro or with third party apps."
Owner in US,"Design, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,It really is a great backend system for adding products and having the orders done through it.,A fantastic way to get into getting an ecommerce site and it can be really great when used in conjunction with wordpress.,I use it in conjunction with WP Shopify and Wordpress. This allows me to have most of the functionality and ability to change the site look through wordpress but also allows me to have the Shopify backend. I don't think many people use it this way but it works well and may be more simple than using wordpress with Woocommerce. Their website options are also very good for those who have less experience with websites.,As a web designer/developer I don't like how rigid the web design looks are. They also don't have as many options with plugins as say woocoommerce and Wordpress does.

Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Great Online Store app for just starting out,I've been with Shopify since 2015 and I'm very happy with them.

Customer service is always right there and I can customize pretty much anything I want. I plan to stay with them:),"I really like the ease of use. You don't have to know a lot of technical computer stuff to be able to set up a great online store. Shopify walks you through the whole process from picking out a theme, listing products and how to process orders. Customer service is great too. Anytime I've had a problem or didn't know how to make something work, they promptly helped me through it.",When I do need to find out some of the technical info (like access keys for setting up email or things like that) is a little tricky to sometimes find.
Business Owner in Sweden,"Sports, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Easy to use for beginners and advanced users,Simply feels safe and with a lot of possibilities.,Feels like Shopify really grows with your knowledge and expertise. You can set it up even as a beginner and when you learn over the years you really can dig into advanced setups. Used it for our webshop https://dietz.se in three languages and switched now to a solution with two extra shops - https://dietzpaddling.de for German speaking customers and https://dietzpaddling.com for English speaking customers.,Setup for some languages (as Swedish) is a bit left behind. But it seems like they are investing even in the smaller markets now.

Plus i love the fact that they have shopify capital which provides you a certain amount like a loan for your business and i think this is great for small businesses like mines!,I like how easily I'm able to create my website without spending hundreds to hire a website developer,The least would probably be having to pay extra to get the full experience such as upgrading to premium subscription
Digital Marketing Manager in UK,"Retail, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Outstanding CMS,Reliability is important and it rarely fails on this front however as every site as standard is on their interface you might want to consider using your own stack. We are on plus and you do need to look at this for all the added benefits.,Clear Analytics and for me the best at integration with 3rd party software. Unrivalled when it comes to making changes and amends and all in all a pleasure to work with.

They've made it so easy to get our store up and running, and to fully customize our site.","I've used Shopify for just about a year for our store's website and I couldn't be more pleased! I've never had any company of any kind have tech support that is SO helpful, friendly, and easy to get a hold of. Shopify has create a huge platform to educate users on their platform and the options available to them. That is a great resource, but on top of that their support team will help solve any problem via chat! I couldn't be happier with our choice to go with Shopify!","I strongly dislike that it's not an option in a shopify site to allow discounts to stack. This is an option I want my customers to have, but Shopify doesn't allow it. Their product pages also have a limited amount of variations available on a single product (size, color, design, etc...) and that's been quite frustrating for us."

I kind of just felt let down once my free trial had ended.
Business Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,I increased sales tremendously with Shopify,"Excellent. I am so happy that I moved over to Shopify from SquareSpace. Nothing wrong with SquareSpace, I just wanted to have a more retail-centric site, instead of just an add-on store. Using Shopify has made it very easy to post my products on Instagram, where my customers are.","Everything was fairly easy to set up, except for running into trouble with my domain transfer from SquareSpace, but I got plenty of help from Shopify Support - and quickly!
I like that there are many website themes to choose from to best suit my needs and that they are all customizable to a large degree.
I also like that there are many available apps to add functionality (payment plans, compare products) and enhance the site (google and yelp reviews).",I wish that Shopify itself had many of the features that I have gotten via third party apps so that Shopify Support would simplify resolution of any issues I have.

Over 10 different online stores with Shopify currently running and I love every second of it! Great software!!,"Shopify is the greatest E-Comm platform around and here's why. You can build a 1000+ product online store in under 5 hours (assuming you have your inventory database completed). You can import a theme from Shopify and give your store a beautiful, mobile optimized design, import your products, and launch your store so fast it will make your head spin. Shopify Payments is really easy to set up and really eliminates the whole ""merchant service"" middle-man piece that used to be an annoying step in building an online store. You also have full access to liquid html and CSS that can be easily customized, especially if you are a well-versed coder, and make your site as custom as you'd like...just stay within the general guidelines otherwise it may not optimize as you'd like.","The monthly fees are a little high especially in the higher tier membership options, but it is a very good software and definitely deserves the entry level fees they charge. Other than that I have no complaints."

Shopify thinks of everything so you don't have to. The apps that integrate with it are plentiful and I'm always learning new ways to improve my site. I've never had a problem with the site I couldn't find the answer to on their website.,I'm hoping to get the POS system to use in my storefront - which is seasonal.

Business Owner in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify Product Review,Very pleasing.,"To be entirely honest, everything about Shopify is a huge plus. It's a game-changer in the eCommerce industry and if any business wants to keep up with online sales, Shopify is the only way to go.","Not many cons, I would say. Took a few days to get the hang of their user dashboard. However, it's robust features, hundreds of apps, and hundreds of themes, are more than enough for their pricing."
Owner in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify provides what they promise,It has been good overall. The customer service is good... not terrific... but good. Their product does exactly what they promise it will do.,"It works all the time. Inventory management interaction with other POS systems (Clover, etc) is extremely lacking and requires a subscription to a third party SAS provider.",Shopify has taken a political stance on several items. We are not a political company and believe that other companies that are not involved directly in politics should also take any position on political issues.

Easy to start, even if you don't have a clue, with their crash courses on how to deploy for different types of businesses. Thousands of useful extensions are available for online store improvements, making it easier to develop a more unique store and improve customer experience. Easy tracking of funds use and availability has been integrated and is optional. Easy to create and sort products according to category and incorporate the use of tag names. It's very easy to integrate print-on-demand services.","As long as orders are placed on Aliexpress you're all good.

Co-Founder in US,"Consumer Goods, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,One of the Best eCommerce packages in a box with just a few small issues.,Great. The support was responsive and the number of plugins is pretty outstanding for a platform this sized.,"How easy it is to get it setup and running if you have simple products, simple shipping and simple tax structures. The templates and themes are great and not too expensive and the support by the template creators are pretty good",Customizing the shopping cart ui is extremely challenging and there is no way I can tell to deal with pair clothing sizes such as a bikini top and bottom as a set. Inventory doesn't support multi-sized variants with inventory tracking so you have to break out the top and bottom into separate products and then write super complex code to put the products together. It's not trivial and you'd think they would work on this problem. We had swimsuits in our store so it was a nightmare.
Owner in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Wonderful selling platform,"Overall, Shopify has been the main tool in helping me to expand my business, and I'm grateful to have found it.","I appreciate the ease in which you can set up your store. Not only that, but Shopify is more robust than Wix or other platforms. You have the integrations that allow you so much expansion and possibilities. The customer support is excellent as well.",The thing that I like least about it is the limited designing tools that you have for the blog posts and pages section. I'd like for it to be more customizable.
owner in US,"Design, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Great Product for Agencies and Project Managers,We have been really happy with using shopify. Out of the other 2 platforms we use I would have to say this one is the best.,Was very easy to use for our clients once we got everything set up correctly. If there was a page builder that would allow for an easier set up for basic site pages.,I think the only issues we have run into is setting up shipping and tax integration with certain vendors.
Owner/Operator in US,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Shopify a giant in the industry for good reasons...,"They've been solid, ive been able to use shopify without having to worry about security and they have a healthy list of venders allowing me to branch out and find more products so i would say a very good experience overall. I've learned a lot.","Very easy to get started, and the way the system is setup beginners can hop on and get to selling right away. Shopify has good categorization, meaning their sections are well built and seperated. So all the shipping stuff is all together in one area as well as apps or your checkout options in their own section.","Everything costs, they'll give you samples, but you'll find that the apps nickel and dime you to death and before you know it your up over $100"
"Graphic Design Software, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,4.0,Clients Love Shopify,"I am not crazy about the flexibility as far as partners go. If you don't bring new customers on a regular basis, you will not get your commission even with clients that you have worked with for years. There is no flexibility there and they really don't seem to care about their partners. Sorry.",Shopify is awesome. I love the ease of use to set up and how easy it is for the client to take over and manage their own site successfully. Shopify has so many help resources available if you have an issue you can usually find it in their resources and if not you can hop on Twitter or Shopify Chat and someone will help you with your issue. Their Shopify Payments (it has a new name now) is easy to set up and makes accepting payments for your products easy and seamless for both the store owner and the customer. There are so many apps available for almost anything.,"What I like least is creating new pages. There isn't a lot of options there. You can go to the APP store and pay a monthly fee to have an app to create a landing page, but not everyone wants to pay an additional monthly fee. Simple things shouldn't require apps."
Director in Brazil,"Accounting Software, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,I really loved how they turned a complex thing in a such a easy to use website.,"It was a really satisfying experience that made extend my license with Shopify and aiming to grow, even more, my e-commerce, because it was simple and easy to get what I was looking for to my website.","Shopify is extremely simple and easy to use. You doesn´t have to know hoe to code, all you need to select the awesome templates already on the platform.
I also liked so much the 24-hour support team, a very excellent team.","It won´t be easy to transfer you content if you are not on an e-ecommerce niche. Also, the URL structure is not the ideal for SEO, which nowadays is extremelly important to e-commerces and for traffi."
"E-Learning, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,Reviewer Source,3.0,Shopify for those who probably won't go far with their business,Overall shopify is nice if you want to dip your toes into dropshipping however I would not recommend it to anyone. Make your own website from other services and add your own products whether that's something online or something you sell yourself. I would recommend you reconsider your need to use shopify as getting into the dropshipping market with a restrictive software that doesn't allow you to add selective products is just a bad idea.,"I don't want to be misleading with my title as there are pro's to using shopify such as it's many user friendly features. Features include being able to design and add elements to your own site without having to code your own website. It allows you to easily add products from their page from their ""large"" collection and shows you useful data such as the number of products being sold in a particular market. It's also free to use and is a nice easy way to get into the dropshipping market like I have.","While I have listed the pro's above of what Shopify does do very well however, there are many things it doesn't do as well such as full customization of your own website. While yes you can edit and change how your website looks it just isn't as custom as some other site creation websites. Finally the biggest deal breaker of them all, the products on their particular market page you have to add from are absolute garbage material most of the time. Any product that isn't utter trash is instead something that is completely oversold, it would most likely lead to you just selling a product that people will most likely not find on your site."

"Machinery, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,4.0,Shopify: The Ultimate Solution for Small Business Owners,"my experience with Shopify over the past two years has been overwhelmingly positive. The platform has allowed me to expand my reach and grow my sales without the need for additional staff. The customer support has also been exceptional, and I've always been able to get the help I need whenever I encounter any issues.",Shopify's interface is easy to use and allows for customization to match your brand's aesthetics. You don't need to be tech-savvy to set up and manage your online store.,"One potential con of Shopify is that some of its features come at an additional cost. While Shopify's basic pricing plan includes essential features such as a website and online store, you may need to pay for additional features like advanced analytics or email marketing. However, while this may seem like a disadvantage, it's important to consider the value that these features can provide to your business."
"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,A great partner with which to build a business,"We began using Shopify eight years ago when starting our online business and have not had any regrets. Shopify has always very functional and easy to use - most importantly though, it continuously evolves and fine tunes all of the components of the platform- order processing, inventory, tracking social media, etc...","Expandability, Functionality, and Technical Customer Service. All are great. Through the years, we've grown our business on Shopify, taking full advantage of all of their platform's built-in resources as well as the ever-expanding app store. For the most part, whatever you're looking to accomplish can be done right from within the Shopify platform.
Very important to mention- their customer service is outstanding! Everyone needs help from time to time and it's great to know that the Shopify Gurus are always there to help.",Analytics. There are basic social media and traffic source info on the main admin page. It would be very helpful to have much more in-depth information to draw from. Maybe a distilled version of Google Analytics that's been broken down spcifically in regards to the store/products?
Co-Founder in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Longtime User,"Overall, I'd recommend shopify to the majority of people looking to sell products online.",Shopify feels like the gold standard for getting an ecommerce brand off the ground and scaled. I've been super happy with it and their product only gets better and better as more third-party companies have smooth integrations.,"Their code framework is just annoying. It's difficult to navigate and make changes, and you're locked out of making changes to certain parts of your site unless you purchase a higher level package."
Owner in US,"Health, Wellness & Fitness, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify Review,Overall pleased with Shopify,"Easy to use
Good selection of Themes and Designs to choose from
There are tons of apps to integrate into the platform to make things much easier
Great for dropshipping
There is a 14 day Free Trial period
Support is good","The amount of apps available can be overwhelming
The additional apps add up and can be costly
Don't have total control over store since Shopify hosts your site"

Ecommerce Sales & Marketing Manager in Canada,"Food & Beverages, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify is Top for a Reason,Very good experience with Shopify. I run 4 stores out of there and would happily recommend.,"There are many reasons why Shopify is #1 right now. They are easy to get started with, the themes are easy to use and range in functionality and robust enough for 7-8 figure sales. Their customer support is also very good.",Where they lag is on the promotions end of the business. There is a lot of basic promotional options that are just not available without installing a 3rd party app. You should be able to do more straight out of the box.
Owner in South Africa,"Marketing & Advertising, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify Review,Shopify is a fantastic platform to use for small business owners! Even a starter e-commerce business has a good chance of making a lot of money just by being a part of the global Shopify community. There is a lot of money to be made on Shopify and you will not regret signing up for the 30 day free trial so please do give it a try for yourself.,What I like most about using Shopify is that as long as you are willing to put in the time and the effort that it would take to upload and name your products correctly you can sell anything on Shopify! Shopify should really be thought of as a mall and you are the owner of one store in that mall. All the customers come to the mall which is Shopify and choose products from your store. That's another thing I really like about using Shopify is that you can own a shop that sells from the smallest cheapest item to a really big store that sells lots of different products at various different prices. It's open for anyone and it is your shop that is open 24 hours a day. So you can make money even when you are asleep!,What I like least about Shopify is that while it is free for the first 30 days of using it you eventually do have to pay for the right to have your store under the umbrella of Shopify. Although there are many aspects that make up for the fact that they want a monthly payment and it is a small amount too so it really is value for money.
jewelry artist in US,"Arts & Crafts, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Simply the best,Excellent.,"I love Shopify. I love that the platform provides everything you need to manage a website, and there is no separate hosting plan to maintain. There are lots of free website templates - or paid ones - that are ready to go. You could create a fabulous site in just a few hours & their customer service is fabulous - positive people & positive solutions.","There are limitations to the free website templates, but, again, customer service will help you create just about anything."

I think it’s great for businesses just starting out and creating a brand it’s also easy for customers to use and it’s very accessible!
I also like the customer service they offer and if there is a problem from there end that they will fix it straight away.
I also especially like the stock tracker it has helped us combat many issues and has helped customer satisfaction!","The only thing that I don’t like about shopify is that it does have technical glitches often although they only last for a short amount of time they can be frustrating if the shop is especially busy!
We have had technical faults thought that have lasted longer periods of time which has been costly to us."

Their product listings are simple and quick. There are no hidden fees or small print as there are with their competitors. With Shopify, the process is much easier than with eBay or other websites.","With the best catalogue management and an easy to use the system, products can be updated easily. They have excellent customer support as well, and everything can be customized quickly. We received prompt help from Shopify's support team. Shopify enables the easy categorization of products, collections, and tags. You can easily use Shopify to manage your catalogue and process orders with a user-friendly interface.","The Shopify tax setup for some countries needs to be reviewed. The US assumes that every country handles taxes the same way, leaving third-world countries with useless and inaccurate tax management."

Founder in US,"Marketing & Advertising, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,A great tool to power your ecommerce shop,"Overall, if you can trade design (or hire a designer) for functionality - Shopify is a sure bet for ecommerce models.",Shopify is a great tool for those who are looking for an easy way to go to market in ecommerce. They have partnered with the best of the best in terms of 3rd party apps that allow small businesses to compete online.,"If Shopify had tools to make design easier, this software would be the total package. Instead, it is one of the more limiting factors when choosing Shopify. It takes a background in code to really customize the look and feel of the site."
Director of Marketing in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is the best eCommerce platform for a simple store,I would say I have had a very pleasant experience with shopify and will continue using it.,"It is not only easy to set up a theme and get started, but also continues to be easy to do any normal features that you would need on a simple eCommerce store.","There are some high end features that are not possible to do when using shopify, unless you upgrade to shopify plus."
,Internet,Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Easy execution. eCommerce platform that focuses on growth for store owners,"I migrated my store from another platform to Shopify. As a non-technical store owner, I was able to achieve more in 7 days than I was able to on 3 months on a different platform.","The low technical skill requirement, the availability of 3rd party apps to enhance the store, the general excitement and size of the community, the availability of vetted experts through their expert directory are all clear advantages. The cherry on top is the attention to design and user experience that is offered through the Shopify dashboard and with the themes in the theme store. Lastly, and most importantly, the customer support is amazing. I once emailed them at 1am on a Sunday morning and got a response in 15 min. What?
Overall, it's just an easy, pleasant experience - but still, don't underestimate the amount of work it takes to put up a profitable shop.","A downside, and it's surely being worked on and considered - is that it's quite complicated to take advantage of theme updates if you've purchased a theme from the theme shop. For this, you need to find technical help and do it very carefully, but this is where the experts directory helps. Shopify takes feedback from the community very seriously and it's why they've experience such awesome growth."
Chief Growth Generator | Digital Growth Strategy and Execution | Growth Hacking | Mentoring in US,"Internet, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify is great but watch those costs...,"I love Shopify in general for smaller merchants. For larger merchants with hundreds or thousands of SKUs, the competition is definitely closer than you'd think. Shopify has many tools and many you have to buy, some of which their competitors integrate. So I take caution recommending Shopify which limits some of what you can do visually and technically, but if customization isn't a big deal and you don't have a ton of products, there's no better solution. If you do, compare because the decision isn't that easy, and the cost and features difference are close between Shopify and other solutions.","Shopify is an incredibly easy platform to do ecommerce on, with all the tools and simple set up that make most of the technical work easy to do...at first. If you are just adding a few products, want a great shopping cart that's fast, and easy to set up, Shopify is one of the best. The design and approach has made it easier for regular people to manage stores without technical know how, and at a low cost...until you start thinking of all the things you can do, that's when it changes a bit.","Shopify seems a cheaper solution, until you start thinking of what to add to your store. Each decision adds a plugin, or requires an upgrade, and soon the costs start escalating. Want a follow up autoresponder for cart abandonment? Upgrade, and/or choose a plugin, adding cost. The simple design hides the fact that there are many hidden costs, and if you are doing lots of products, think hundreds or thousands, you need to do a Cost Benefit analysis because this quickly becomes a pricier solution. The app community while robust is filled with small apps that really are small small businesses, and can do what they do but not much else, and support varies greatly. So going into Shopify, your first impressions won't be your final ones, depending on how complex your requests are."
Sales Manager in UK,"Information Technology & Services, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,3.0,Just so many add ons,"We need a retail website and quick. shopify was the obvious choice but, once we had the need for basic product or template upgrades, it is 3rd party app for this, third party app for that. I think Shopify could really be a little more honest with it's pricing. Basic Shopify is fine, Enterprise level is probably OK because you are paying them a lot of money but, anywhere in between and you cannot hope to set a useful budget for your eCommerce requirements","A nice, easy, out of the box ecommerce site builder, up and running in a matter of days","We grew, we needed more. Shopify couldn't/wouldn't improve the basic functions. I think it is at the mercy of its 3rd party app developers as it doesn't want to lose them. Outside of a basic retail site, unless you are going for enterprise version, there is no useful middle ground"
Community Manager in US,"Internet, 201–500 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,A Most Reliable Platform to Create Pages for Online Stores,"Its various apps and plugins help in improving customization and enhancing the performance of your online businesses. A lot of features are provided in it for managing and assisting your stores includes accounting, marketing, sales, inventory, reporting, shipping and many others. External payment providers and third-party integrations are not required for it as it is providing a lot of payment procedures itself that includes Apple Pay, PayPal, Amazon Pay, Google Pay etc.",No technical background is required for setting up your online store with Shopify. You can improve and enhance your sales and customers as it is providing a lot of marketing tools that will help in enhancing your marketing activities. It is providing custom templates for easily building your setups or websites through it. Variety of premium and free applications are provided in it for enhancing your sales activities.,Most of its features are requiring third-party services but you have to purchase these services. It will charge an additional fee for payment processes if you are using external processes for payments. More enhanced SEO capabilities are required. It does not provide fast and automated processes for listing products. Reconfiguring most of its templates are not easy.
General Manager in Singapore,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,3.0,Easy to use but UI UX needs an upgrade,"I helped a friend who owns an online wine business to edit his home page, create promotional banners, coordinated the integration of recurring subscription, and also managed to edit the backend codes of his shopping carts in the PHP. I find the main administrative platform (for managing products) easy to use, however the interface rather of a legacy one. Finding developers from Shopify's own panel is challenging, eventually we found a developer on Upworks who is able to work on the recurring subscription and Stripe payment integration for us. He also wanted to create promotion landing pages and that we found can be done using a separate plugin on Shopify, which is easy to use, but costly as it adds on an additional cost monthly and if we didn't create landing pages often enough, it's not totally worth it. However getting a developer to work on additional requirement for landing pages is just as costly as paying long term subscription. In summary Shopify scores the highest in terms of basic product administration, anything more than that requires help from developers and additional costs.","It's easy to log in for the basic product management tasks such as to change product, prices, inventory levels, product features, check orders, etc. In this aspect, for users who are not digitally savvy, it's easy to use.","Firstly, the platform UI UX needs an upgrade. The whole software seems like a legacy system and lack intuition. Certain integration such as payment gateway, recurring subscription, branding home page all requires professional technical help. Of course I understand that there is an ecosystem of developers to work on integration tasks. Secondly, the templates are rather standard, as such I find that there is a disconnect between Shopify's marketing ad copy on Google ads 'Beautiful Themes That Are Responsive And Customizable' and the actual templates you can find on the platform. Thirdly, the photo editor hardly work properly, I can't seem to be able to edit the uploaded photo the way I want it to be cropped. Just like the photo editor on CMS systems such as Wordpress, quite disappointing."

It better cost saving with self maintenance as compare to Wordpress, Magento, Opencart which have many hidden cost and developer will charge quite costly",When creating new pages or category the subdomain url will have the word pages to make the subdomain url slightly longer example https://www.abc.com/pages/about-us and if its transfer website from Wordpress to Shopify will have some url issue therefore need to fill all the url to redirect.

Founder | Online Marketing Consultant in US,"Marketing & Advertising, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,I only recommend Shopify for ecommerce to friends and clients.,"I've used other wordpress ecommerce solutions in the past, but they were incredibly clunky to use. Shopify is built from the ground up to help you run an ecommerce business. I already built and sold a store on Shopify and their Sellers Marketplace and now I help clients who run their businesses on Shopify. I wouldn't recommend anything else for ecommerce.","Helps you make money!
All in one ecommerce solution.
Super fast and helpful customer support with any issue I've ever had.
Tons of apps on the marketplace to help you with any customization needs.
Easy to create staging themes before pushing your changes live.
Easily integrates with google analytics and facebook pixels with just a couple of clicks.","Blog functionality isn't the best, but that's not their focus so I understand. I'd recommend setting up a subdomain for your blog instead and installing wordpress for that. However, if Shopify's blogging features were better, it'd be awesome for managing your products and content all in one place.
I also wish you could edit the checkout code and customize that more easily without having to upgrade to the highest tier plan they offer. It's quite expensive to do so and a lot of smaller stores could benefit from modifying the checkout to help improve conversions."

If you're happy with one of their modern, yet free, themes, your online store can be up and running in a matter of minutes. Great solution for businesses wanting to start out with eCommerce but don't want to commit to extensive and custom online store development.","Deep customisation is relatively limited, unless you are proficient in liquid code. Page layouts are simple and don't offer unique layouts within the page editor. For the majority of stores, this won't matter as the standard Shopify themes and functions are sufficient."

IT consultant in US,"Information Technology & Services, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,A nice trouble-free ecommerce system for both new and established stores,"Very smooth. As I have previously mentioned, if you have the budget and want to set up an e-commerce store without having to hire a web developer and do a lot of testing, Shopify is the way to go.","The Shopify platform is very stable and easy to set up. First spend some time organizing products, gathering product photos, writing product descriptions, and map out how you want the store organized.
We were able to get the store up and running within a few hours. It is by far the easiest and quickest way to set up an e-commerce store. I recall in the early 2000s, setting up a store would take weeks and then it would require hiring QA people to test it.","The monthly cost of a Shopify store can be high. If you already have a running business with clients, it is not so bad, but if you are just starting out and need to build up a client base, you might have to wait a few months before you start covering the monthly Shopify costs.
Due to the costs, I usually do not recommend using Shopify to new business owners until they have some money coming in."

There are a lot of fees and app fees that add up which are required to make it work. That said, there are no heavy front end fees and it works with everything. On a personal note, I find Shopify the real poor man's company of Shopify Plus which would be ideal, but that's a much larger monthly commitment. That said. If Shopify was as good as Shopify Plus no one would want to pay for plus.",Its back end is great. It integrates with everything. It's the shopping cart leader and you can be up and running very quickly.,"I think it's because they want to differentiate between the Shopify plus, but I found Shopify to be rather slow and the shopping cart end page needed to be altered for better conversions, (but now there are apps that do that.)

Compared to the Magentos and Demandwares out there, Shopify is a fast build. I had a website built in 3 months. Lots of out-of-the-box features that are crucial to running a business. The Live Chat support function is the best thing - so many question my team had, that normally would be sent to my web dev agency, could be answered by the Shopify Gurus in live chat. This empowered my team to seek answers on their own, which in turn led them to come up with ideas and solutions that they brought to the table and we implemented.","The refund and store credit reporting needs improvement. My finance team got a lot of headaches trying to reconcile everything at the end of the month. If you have a 3rd party return app, Shopify may not play well with reporting units returned to stock and amount refunded."
eCommerce Co-Founder in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,A Love Hate Relationship,Can't beat it for the price; you get a lot for even the basic package since users do not have to worry about any security breaches or servers going down often. Shopify is almost always up and rarely slow due to their CDNs.,"Makes it easy for users to set up an ecommerce shop without worrying about CDNs, Servers, and security. Shipping rates are subsidized as well.","Most basic features are locked behinds monthly subscriptions. A lot of coding is done with liquid which isn't too hard to learn, but would be more intuitive if it just stuck to Javascript, HTML, CSS, and BooStrap."
BDM in India,"Information Technology & Services, 201–500 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Best Website development platform,,,
Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Good small business solution,"Overall it's a good way for a small business to have an online presence. Shopify says I'm doing better than 90% of new websites but I've done a very small # of sales (mostly sell on amazon), so it must take a long time for new online retailers to establish themselves. So far it hasn't been worth the cost of setup, but I'm hoping it will take off in the future as more customers trust my website.","I like that I can track my inventory easily using Shopify. It can even integrate with Amazon, although I haven't used it that way and just update quantities manually when I ship to Amazon. I like how easy it is to add a new product and product variations.","I feel like the Facebook integrations are great in theory but don't really work as intended. My products keep getting flagged as inappropriate when they're blankets or products for kids, very strange. Also, the function to market on facebook through Shopify doesn't work. I've tried to set it up multiple times and tried to find customer support for this but was unsuccessful. I also feel like getting things to look good on the front end was rather tedious and was annoyed that I had to use another app to do this as well as send out mass emails, just another added monthly cost."
,Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,5.0,I've developed several themes and shops with Shopify,It is quick to get started developing and has great basic documentation and support for shopkeepers.,"The platform (from the perspective of a developer, not a shopkeeper) is fantastic. It takes a bit to learn, but it was clearly built thoughtfully with the aim of making it a seamless process for a store owner to get online and serve their customers quickly. Compared to building a shop with Shopify vs Wordpress vs from scratch, Shopify is good at doing what it set out to do.","The support/community available to developers is nothing like the open source support/community that is available for other tools. As I was getting started developing, I felt like Shopify provided excellent documentation for folks interested in opening a shop, but not so much for developers trying to learn the system. The basic documentation is there from Shopify, but there isn't a central place where one can go and find answers to the tricky bits one runs into over the course of developing a theme/shop. I get it that they're trying do develop an ecosystem that is mutually beneficial to developers and shopkeepers and Shopify and so maybe it's intentional to make you have to 'earn' it to keep the pool of people involved tight."
Shopify esshaimi in Morocco,"Marketing & Advertising, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,Shopify review - esshaimi,"Through my experience of Shopify, I found some difficulties and problems, and in return, it enabled me to create a professional and integrated website of my own.","Shopify is a global platform for entrepreneurs and merchants, and it is the most appropriate place to start your business on it, as this platform helps you to create your own professional and integrated website as it provides you with many themes that suit your business in addition to its availability of several free and paid add-ons that are also compatible with Your site and contribute to making your website integrated and suitable to facilitate the process of dealing with it by visitors to your site in addition to that you can link your store with several banks, including PayPal Bank, in order to receive money on it if your site is a commercial website, and of course you will not You find problems navigating the site because it responds quickly and efficiently","Among the problems that I face in the Shopify site is the difficulty of accessing the available options because they are not prominent and clear and also in terms of the cost of the service, they are expensive from the start and in the stage of preparing your website, you will find some problems and difficulties in modifying and moving between all those available settings"
Manager in US,"Maritime, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Easy to use Retail Point Of Sale,Overall I am highly satisfied with Shopify and would recommend for small businesses. The integration with our marketing and sales tools are extremely helpful and gives us a lot of versatility as not to miss a sale opportunity and even generating more leads and potential sales. The software is very easy to use and training is very short to get new employees on track to contribute to our success,Intergrated with multiple payment options including Apple Pay and other 3rd party Credit Merchants. Keeps accurate invoicing and pricing. Keeps our inventory on track for reordering merchandise (Although Shrinkage is hard to track in real time) The POS can be used on iPads which allows our staff to process transactions while the customer is shopping instead of having them wait for a register if paying in card. Provides good analytics on what products are hot and cold. Integrates well with other 3rd party vendors and marketing sites / companies,We would like more information in regards to shrinkage and monitor for acceptable levels and provide red flags for any excessive amounts
Website Designer in Pakistan,"Information Technology & Services, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,Best E-Commerce solution for beginners as well as Advanced users,"Best thing is that it provides out of the box complete site for merchants having no technical knowledge. It includes hosting and domain so quick and easy start up for an online shop. Trial version is available to get an insight how it works then one can go for Basic plan. For professional needs,If one knows web coding or hire web developer then the shopify themes can even be customized further more than default available settings. Overall it provides an all-in-one smooth experience for building an online store with fast loading website and secured payments.","First of all it's has quick and easy setup to get started with an online store. It includes variety of different responsive design, modern as well as minimal themes are available shopify. Various plugins enhance it's functions & features and provide integration options with online stores like Amazon and Ebay. It has hassle free speed for store website loading and secured options for payment .Shopify provide marketing tools for your business as well as customer records. Customer support is very responsive and efficient in solving issues, which is available 24 hours.",I think it's cost is more. Although different packages are available for user requirement but comparing it to competitors like Magento & WooCommerce it still looks a little expensive. Transaction fees are also an overhead cost that can be avoided only if you use default shopify payment processing which is available in limited countries.
sales representative in Nigeria,"Wholesale, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify Ecommerce Software 2022 Review,My overall experience is great as i did not need to learn to code before I can have my own store.,"Shopify is the best choice for me when considering selling my products online. The storefront is cool and it has amazing features that enable me to sell my product, market my goods and collect payment online from my customers. In terms of marketing my products, it helps me to integrate my social media account for smooth marketing. With Shopify, I can depend less on inventory management through drop shipping my products from Alibaba. I was able to integrate different payment options with a ready-made Shopify store. It is easy to set up and use.",I do not have any cons at the moment. I only wish they extend their trial period or reduce their starting cost as some of us in Africa may not have a customer to buy our product within the trial phase and hence may not be encouraged to set up a store. It works perfectly for those that have customers already.
"Government Administration, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,5.0,My Top Choice for E-Com Stores,"In short, the only choice (IMO) for an ecommerce store. The pricing is great and it's literally ready to go with a few hours of setup.","Shopify makes things simple and easy. The price for the software is nothing (monthly/yearly) for what you get. You can pick from a bunch of themes and can easily start setting up your shop. You don't need to learn code and they have a TON of tools to help you get your store running. They have a Free logo designer, Terms and Conditions creator, and so much more. They want to see you succeed. You can connect your PayPyal account, an outside payment processor or even get some hardware to sync it with your physical store. It's simply a pleasure building an e-com store there. I would only build an e-com store here. If you're looking to only blog or SEO, go Wordpress.","Sometimes the customization can feel a little lacking. This only applies if you don't know any code. You can always pick new themes and play with the settings, but sometimes certain customization requires a little technical background. Their support team is awesome though, and can usually help you accomplish things you're looking to do that are outside of the box."
Director in UK,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Great software,"We are able to run and market our e-commerce business with shopify relatively easy. Very easily integrated all social media platforms with the click of a button. Overall, positive experience with Shopify and would recommend",Back-end is easy to use for a novice. Great security features and you are able to customise the templates without any programming knowledge.,The best features are only available at the higher price plans and to get a lot of additional features at lower price plans you need to rely on paid apps.
Procurment manager in US,"Health, Wellness & Fitness, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Run a profesional online store using shopify,"If you want to run a successful online store, you will want to use Shopify.","My job requires me to not just sell inventory, but to buy inventory as well. Shopify helps me handle online sales by keeping track of my inventory, automatically adjusting the count as items are sold. Also makes communication between myself and the customers easy by the automatic emails as order are shipped and easy access to send them invoice and email them any questions I may have. When I am buying items from other websites, I can always tell if I am buying items from a store who uses shopify. It is very neat and professional looking.","To make the most out of shopify, you need to purchase add-ons that can run the cost higher then originally expected."
Cofounder in US,"Consumer Goods, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Best out of the box website creator,"Most of the time I had no issues. If you do have issues, customer service is a hit or miss. I’ve had terrible experiences and okay ones.",I loved how easy it was to get a website up and running with Shopify. From the moment you create an account to your first order takes only a few minutes. Makes everyone an entrepreneur!,The out of box website creation tools can be lackluster. Themes on Shopify are not heavily customizable.
Sales/promotions manager in US,"Events Services, 501–1,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Very innovative modern platform,"Good experience overall, but would like to see some of the basic features being offered.","The mobile dashboard in the app is extremely to use and get around, the manage inventory is good the way you can add or take away inventory, refund process is quit easy, setting up customer accounts because they can create an account if needed or they can go in and continue as a guest.","1. You can't give a customer or issue any type of store credit which can become somewhat of a headache. 2. Local pickup only available I was blown away by this, I thought Shopify would have all the basic features."
Owner in US,"Consumer Goods, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,"Shopify is easy to set up, customize and update",Shopify has been an essential tool to use for our ecommerce business.,There are endless possibilities for templates you can use to customize your site based on your business needs. Tracking and fulfilling orders is simple. The analytics provide good data to gauge how your marketing efforts are working.,"There have been a few things I have not been able to figure out. For example, how to get reviews to auto-populate on my product pages. The customer has to click on the review tab to read them."
Senior Interior designer - Showroom Manager in Jordan,"Design, 1,001–5,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The platform is simple to set up. Easily develop your brand,"Shopify helps small and new businesses achieve their goals, grow their online trade, and reach a bigger market. Don't hesitate to start an online business to build a strong brand and achieve amazing success. With Shopify, you can start your own store in minutes and then take use of all the excellent services Shopify has to offer, from product presentation to collection.","Shopify is a major platform that helps new and emerging brands construct online stores and sell their products globally. Shopify lets you pick the best display method for you. From the settings panel, you may create your own area to present your products in a way that appeals to all customers, and you can collect the price of the goods or services sold in numerous ways. I enjoy how easy it is to upload product photographs and links, and how responsive the help crew is.","Nothing to note, Shopify is a very easy-to-use platform with quick processes and affordable membership options that help you increase sales and get new clients."
"Information Technology & Services, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,4.0,"Shopfiy has a great checkout system, but the themes offered and filters can be a hassle","Shopify is an easy sell and choice for creating eCommerce websites when looking for a reliable cart and checkout system. It stands out as the most cost effective and trusted solution in comparison to Wordpress or Magento implementations. However, for theme development, customisation and content updates it leaves much to be desired, to the point I wouldn't recommend it without careful testing and consideration.","The checkout system is great, and the product and inventory management works as you'd hope, with decent extension options via plugins. Pricing is reasonable too, and Shopify feels well trusted.","The admin area is a bit of a UX nightmare when it comes to doing basic content edits for any theme that I've encountered. When running Shopify themes through internal QA, we've often found that filter systems and store listing configurations have been quite troublesome compared to other competing platforms."
Owner in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify User,"I currently use Shopify for eComm and POS. I have no plans of changing that any time soon. It works well for the point my business is in now. However, I do feel at some point we will outgrow Shopify.","Shopify is easy to use and the customer service is very helpful. This platform is perfect for small businesses just getting started. The wide variety of website templates offer plenty of options and even if you aren’t advanced in technology, you c an build your own website. Integrations with other apps provides additional functionality but most cost a monthly fee adding to your monthly costs.","The reporting is not as detailed as it needs to be unless you’re on the highway plan. It’s enough to get by but does require some manual work on behalf of the bookkeeper. It can be glitchy when updates are being made which is an annoyance but thankfully it’s fairly rare. Returns/exchanges are a pain point even though that process is improving. Lastly, it desperately needs an inventory management system."
Associate Software Engineer in India,"Computer Software, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Great E-commerce platform to have the online store in few days,I have the excellent experience while working on shopify. It is the best platform. Highly Recommended.,Shopify is one of the best platform that helped me to create the online store in just few days. It is very easy to use and customised. I was able to customised and create the store as per the requirement in few steps.,I dint think there is anything that I did not liked about it. I think it is the best platform for the beginners to have there own store in less price.
Marketing Manager in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Probably the Best on the Market,"Shopify not only serves as the host of our online ecommerce store, but it also processes all of our online payments, collects customer information, easily integrates with numerous other software platforms needed for day-to-day operations, analyzes data, and provides opportunities to upsell customers easily. It really can accomplish just about anything we need!","Shopify's platform is very straightforward and easy to use, on both the front-end and back-end. Whenever I have questions about the software or any of its numerous integrative apps, I can usually find an answer online through an article discussing the problem in detail. The data collected by Shopify is extremely helpful in making business decisions, and it has become my one-stop-shop for most of my information and customization options.","On the occasional instance when I can't solve a problem on my own, it can be difficult to get an answer from the Customer Support team. There have been a few glitches that Shopify's team has been unable / unwilling to solve, and the platform does crash sometimes. It's rather rare, but when it does happen, we are left without a store front which can be a scary scenario to be in."
Owner in US,"Consumer Goods, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify is Great for New Shop Owners,Overall I personally love Shopify and my experience has been great.,"Shopify has great customer service, anytime I've ever needed help with anything they are very helpful.
Plenty of free training to help you get started and even to help you grow your store.
I've tried other platforms for my online store and Shopify is the best.",The one thing I would appreciate that they wouldn't charge you until your site is live. They have a short free trial in which if you are new to Shopify you are still learning it and not ready to go live just yet.
Marketing Manager in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Excellent for Beginners to Advanced Users,"Excellent. Started a business back in college and used Shopify, made quite a bit of beer money which was great.","Beginners can make easy use of this software like I did around 5 or so years ago. Advanced users can toy around with CSS if they want. It's a great platform that has a lot of easy to use and useful features. Great if you want to start simple but eventually learn more and more as you progress and learn advanced techniques. Can't really do that with Wix, and I thought Squarespace would be the same way based on what I've heard about it. Want to open up a store online right away for a low cost and come out with something that looks great with minimal effort? Shopify is for you.","I really don't have anything bad to say. More customization if I want to get nit picky, but I'd just go to Wordpress and build something from scratch there if I needed to, it will just take me longer so Shopify is the way to go as long as it has everything you need, and for a lot of people it does."
Digital Marketing Specialist in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,We Love Shopify - Our Client Loves Shopify,This is definitely the platform I recommend to people who want to sell products online.,"* Easy for me to use

I would recommend it to anyone who is starting an e-Commerce business with no coding team behind. The support team is really good.,"It's easy to use, links with most apps, shows off latest results and is constantly being updated and improved with more and useful features for e-commerce.","For starter - the price!!! Mensal fee, PayPal (you need to have it if you want to able your costumers to pay online) comissions, paid apps, paid templates.
It also has been showing some bugs with the Facebook product linking."
Business owner in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,A huge fan of Shopify,Amazing! I changed from Wix and won’t go anywhere else,I actually love everything about Shopify. It’s literally an all in one! It has all the features or app a small business owner needs to stand with the big guys,"The monthly subscription is high but it’s worth it. I wish more apps were free for growing the business (privy, sms, etc). The more money we make and have to potential to grow our consumer list - the more Shopify makes."
Web Developer in South Africa,"Information Technology & Services, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,3.0,Good for online retail only,I used Shopify to develop an e-commerce presence for one of my clients.,"It's great for online retail as it provides integrations with all major payment gateways and shipping providers.
Everything is already set up - you just need to add your own code on top of it all.","Implementing custom themes and functionality (apps) isn't the easiest of processes.
The file structure cannot be changed - can't add sub-folders other than what is already there.
It costs too much and I wish there was a ""pay as you sell"" option.
Besides the base fee, you pay for many plugins, themes and features (and sometimes these costs are surprisingly included in the Shopify monthly bill)"

FreeLancer in Brazil,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify For E-commerce With 14 Days of Free,"This software exceeded my expectations on the whole. From registration on the platform to the first sale of products. Too TOP to work with, and the free themes are awesome. Very beautiful and flashy layout.","This tool is great for those who want to undertake on the internet, have a store, physical and are interested in migrating to online sales. I more than recommend Shopify. The highlight with this tool was, when I started in the inline venture, when I didn't know how things worked and I came across a free shopify plan, I ventured to create my online store, however, soon I was surprised. Because they increased the free time from 14 days to 3 months. This was awesome. I just thank the creators. Features and price at anyone's level. So even if you don't know anything about it. You can contact support and help guides within the platform, and you will quickly be 100% integrated and with total success in your online project.
As a last note: the plugins and extensions that can be used to integrate the platform, which sped up the process of automatically publishing the products on shopify. This is too much.","I really have no cons about this software, support always agile, and integration tools always very functional."

Owner in US,"Consumer Goods, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,Inexpensive Ecommerce Platform,Overall Shopify is a nice Ecommerce platform that is more affordable than Woocommerce.,"I like the pricing tiers, where I can upgrade as my business grows, they have a lot of blog posts to help businesses. I like their tutorials to help the user use Shopify, it isn’t hard to understand and do yourself. You can also integrate a lot of third party apps. I also like that they have an app I can use on other devices, if I don't want to be on my computer.","I think the dashboard could be better and easier to use, it could use more free templates to customize. Some third party apps aren't that great."
IT Director in US,"Automotive, 201–500 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Motorsport ecommerce store,So far I have use several other platforms for ecommerce solutions and would say that Shopify is number 1 that I have used.,Love the ease of setup a basic site but then the access to the app store for additional apps and designs to use. We use it for ebay also which makes a one place dashboard to manage all of our incoming orders to ship.,Be carful on adding apps and the transaction fees to spike and if you go over the said amount monthly you get another fee.
Entrepreneur in Jamaica,"Furniture, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify Pros and Cons,My overall experience with Shopify has been a great one. It does almost all the work for me in terms of monitoring my store.,"Shopify has proven to be the best eCommerce platform for online based businesses. Their customer service is very reliable. You can get help from their team via live chat, email or call. The spread of your website is very fast. When creating your website, they are a variety of ready templates available that are suitable for many business types. Shopify provides a wide variety information on how your store is performing, in relation to sales, marketing, website visits etc. Shopify gives one the accessibility to connect other apps that can make one online store more user friendly. On Shopify, your store also has the ability to accept payments from a wide variety of countries with diverse currencies.",Most of the extension apps that Shopify offers are apps that requires payments in order to have access to all their features. More currencies could also be added so that all countries can shop from stores all all around the world.
Online Digital Marketer in Nigeria,"Information Technology & Services, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Highly Recommended to create a good online Presence for Ecommerce business,"Customer assistance is rather simplified thanks to Shopify. Automations are set up to notify our customers of shipments, deliveries, or other events without our involvement.","One of the best e-commerce platform for use with online shops is Shopify. To directly enable our consumers to shop our website through email links provided on a weekly basis, we were able to easily incorporate it into other software systems like Klaviyo.
I really adore how accessible and simple Shopify is to use, including for placing orders, looking up prior ones, searching clients' past purchases, etc.
Dovetale, an affiliate marketing tool offered by Shopify, is even free for users, which is a major perk since competing platforms charge hundreds of dollars every month!","It might be costly to experiment with various themes and layouts.
You might need to properly learn it because it is a little technical, especially Google analytics."
President in US,"Entertainment, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify,Best solution in market for creating an online store.,"There are a lot of plugins (they call it apps). Most of them have a free plan and the rest are pretty cheap compared to the value they bring to the store using them. A lot easier to configure than Wordpress (WooCommerce). There are very, very impressible themes (some are free), and without mentioning the huge documentation that is available for beginners (This is where I learned all I know about Shopify). They offer a free app to manage the store. These apps are available for iOS and Android, and they are an advantage over Wordpress with WooCommerce. Besides that, Shopify uses to give new users coupons for advertising; last time I used them, coupon was $200 USD on Google Adwords. As a last fact, they have a really good customer service (phone, chat, Twitter, and email). You can ask almost anything to those agents in customer service; they are really well trained. There is not need to wait, customer service is there 24/7.","When Shopify Payments is not being used, Shopify charges a 2% on total of transaction."

Senior Data Analyst in US,"Marketing & Advertising, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,THE e-retail standard for selling products and services,"I've used Shopify in multiple situations, all of which related to data analysis and sales optimization. I have relied heavily on their reports to understand performance throughout the marketing funnel. Additionally, the data captured is helpful for understanding customer lifetime value and last-touch return on advertising spend when justifying marketing budgets. Shopify is scalable and offers a number of solutions for different-sized companies.","Shopify is used as a sales platform for retailers for their products and services. I like the granularity of the data captured: orders, customers, time series can all be selected for later analysis. Extensive documentation (within a community of users, and from the platform directly) provide guidance on how to implement and use the platform. From a back-end, it's easy to navigate and access different performance reports and understand how (and where, and why) data is captured throughout the sales cycle. Additionally, Shopify lets you pass advertising/marketing information to each individual order, so you can get a better full-funnel understanding of buying habits and conversion.","Integration with third-party plugins/widgets can be clunky and difficult to implement. Automating report / data exports would be a great feature, otherwise we just use an API to dump the data into a warehouse and then query/analyze."

You can go from signing up to selling something on your website in the span of one hour easily. Shopify's customer service is out of this world and helpful even on the most complex questions. On the back-end tracking your sales, invoices, and shipping could not be easier and it's all right there at your fingertips OR literally at your fingertips on your mobile device. I found it incredibly easy to set up our shop, list inventory, add photos, and change our website template and I am a professional Web Developer who would normally recommend something more custom to people, but if you need a quick shop... Shopify is your, pun intended, one stop shop.","Shopify can sometimes be tricky to do more complex things with your inventory and some neat features are wrapped into extensions for your shop, which sounds great until you find the one you want and realize that not only does it cost you to buy it but it is going to (normally) cost you extra every single month you use it which is really kind of a bummer for a lot of features that would be really nice additions to the core of Shopify, unfortunately I don't remember any specific examples of that because I haven't used Shopify in a little over a year now after our shop closed, but that's what I recall being the only thing I wasn't fond of."
Digital & Ecommerce Coordinator in US,"Luxury Goods & Jewelry, 501–1,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify Review,Great platform with a multitude of apps to create a robust website.,"One feature that stood out from the other platforms was the ease of Facebook shopping integration.
This really helped to open up our social channels as a gateway sales channel as well as drive conversions from social.","While I believe this is a great platform for small to medium businesses, I struggled with 2 main things:
1. Manually merchandising products. Within a collection that has over 100+ products, it is challenging to manually drag and drop each product to it's desired position.
2. Live updating banner/image assets. It would be great to have a scheduling feature where you could input a date to make banners and image updates. The scheduling feature is available at the product level, but not"
Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Great Ecommerce and Website Building Tools,"Overall, it is a wonderful website bulding and ecommerce platform!!",I think I love everyting about Shopify. It is super user friendly. You start with a free trial and see if templates meet your needs. They have wonderful customer support. They always try to solve your problem and they are always responsive. You can chat with them anytime you need. Ecommerce sokutions work great. I never ever had aproblem with my payments or website.,"Some templates (even if they are paid templates) have less features. So you have to be very careful before buying a template, because you can’t get a refund for a template, even if you just bought it minutes ago and changed your mind (that’s because you see the codes once you purchase the template and in theory you can just take the codes and replicate that website). Anyways, work on that template in a detailed way (that’s totally free). Customize that template and only buy it after you are sure that this is the right template."
Creative Director in Venezuela,"Graphic Design Software, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,"Have your online store, and manage it yourself","I liked my experience as it takes all your inventory, try to modify something of the template, and the page of Shopify developers is very good if you seek help or support from the Shopify team, I could improve the template to my liking, and I learned a little more on how it works. Add several discounts, and use many app for discounts and make it look visually attractive.","What I like most about this platform, is that you can build your website yourself, choose your template how you want it to look. you assemble the products of your preference, you can have your categories, tags, promotions, easy to use. and you also have the inventory of your store.
Shopify gives you a lot of applications, to make your website more complete, for example you can add an app that helps you create promotions banners, or label for discount products, or some application so that your product pages are monthly, so like many others that facilitate the management and improvement of it.
Receive many methods of payment, which is very good at the time that the customer wants to pay with methods not very well known, but Shopify is very friendly with that.","Something that is not very easy to handle, if you have no knowledge is the templates, if you are very basic just fill with your info and ready, but if you want to change a little aspect, you require or modify the code of the template, or add more apps to help you
The monthly price is very high, but I think it's worth it because they handle several things on a single platform."

Managing Editor in US,"Computer Games, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify Makes It Easy To Manage An Online Store,We set up a Shopify store to sell limited edition prints of rare Nintendo Switch games. The process was super easy to manage and sales of our stock went flawlessly while it was available. I can see us using Shopify again the next time we have a collection to sell to long-time readers.,"Shopify has one click deployment to make it easy to set up. It's dead simple to add products and keep track of inventory. You can also set up user accounts to allow employees to edit things like inventory count and prices. Setting up discounts is also robust, allowing for one-time use codes, email promotions, and more.","Shopify is very extensible, but sometimes that can lead to confusion for web newbies. I am very familiar with managing websites and had no problems in the backend, but it is not always intuitive, based on employee feedback."
Marketing Publicity Manager S in Mexico,"Entertainment, 1,001–5,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Economical and highly customizable shopping cart,"We needed to introduce a shopping feature to our existing website and were looking for a business that could be introduced as cheaply and quickly as possible. The biggest advantage of Shopify was that the basic plan was cheap and immediately available. There was no problem with credit card payments, the flow from application to review to entry was fast, and most credit cards could be used immediately. When I used it, I was impressed with the broad ecosystem with enhanced APIs to connect to other systems such as Instagram and Slack, the management of multiple SKUs within a single product, and the introduction of apps. Cooperation with the notification tool system is helpful in eliminating mail order omissions. It was a great advantage to get suggestions for the future development of channels such as Instagram.","The rental shopping cart with ""Buy Button"" does not require any code implementation for HTML or JavaScript, so the design is highly customizable. The button itself can also be customized by providing a GUI screen for the design on the Shopify side.","I think it's unavoidable depending on the brand, but it's difficult to capture warehouse sales because the transfer time is different for each order."

It offers great flexibility in terms of customization, a broad feature set, and an active community that’s always ready to offer support.","One of the standout features of Shopify is its user-friendly interface, which makes it easy to customize my store without needing to have specialized technical skills. I can choose from a variety of templates and themes that fit your brand, and tweak them to make them truly unique. It also offers a comprehensive range of features such as product inventory management, order and shipping management, customer management, and marketing tools.Another great feature of Shopify is its app store, offering a wide range of plugins to boost my store's functionality, from abandoned cart recovery to email marketing to social media integration. Most of the apps are reasonably priced and easy to integrate, making it straightforward to scale up My business.However, it's worth noting that Shopify's transaction fees might feel like a downside for some, especially for small businesses.

What has really sold me, though, is Shopify's customer service. The people they hire are knowledgeable and incredibly friendly. In the beginning , I called them quite a bit and one of their ""gurus"" always had answer and was pleasant about it, no matter how many times I called. :) This has continued to this day and , at least for now , I am a customer for life. I will be opening a second store within the next year and will use Shopify for this store as well.","I guess, my only con is that I do wish there was some sort of storage for items and pictures I delete. Sometimes I do have a second thought about an item and it would be nice if I could just bring the ad back up in some way without having to re - write the copy."

Won't actually recommend this for newbies.","Shopify offers possibilities to sell high-quality digital or physical products with lots of eCommerce themes available to give you that perfect store portrait you've got in your mind & easy to customize too.
Has a lot of integrated apps(easy to install) to expand and widen your store frontend features. Shopify supports different payments like Paypal, stripe, and apple money.
Facebook pixels installation is very easy.","Thye offers no automatic backups. There actually don't exist any possibilities to undo/recover accidentally deleted files.
The majority of useful apps come at an extra fee which I think is somehow exorbitant.
I think Shopify is not beginner-friendly, you need the training to make proper configurations."

But also a couple of disadvantages you should think about before deciding.","it's easy to use, you don't have to worry about technicalities. The quality and quantity of their designs are excellent, and if you can't find the right design you can also create your own or buy one. Also the flexibility of the core system and templates are great. It's also easy to scale for small and big online stores. The App also have useful add-ons for your online store. And the support group is always available 24 hours.","It has a URL structure that is not ideal for SEO, and the use of its subdirectories for e.g pages, blogs or news. And the multi-language department that is still slowly improving. And the charges of the transaction fees on top of the payment methods e.g paypal. Also creating your regular content is not easy."

The Shopify Payment Gateway has lower commissions in comparison with others. As a developer, I like Shopify because it has allowed me to deliver robust e-commerce sites in less time than with other platforms. The Shopify store has beautiful themes and many apps that expands the functionalities and capabilities of the platform.","I really like Shopify but sometimes the most basic task could be cumbersome: filtering collections by options as color, size or type in a more complex way could only be done with applications, no native support (consider that other platforms manage this without the use of apps or plugins). Also, when developing themes with Shopify, reusing sections in different pages could not be done at the time of writing this review."

First, they offer you a 14-day trial to learn everything about Shopify, to customize your store, and then you can pay a little to nothing for using Shopify.

Their customer support is very professional which is very important because it's an e-commerce software that makes you money and you don't want to wait for someone to solve the problem!","The one thing that bothers me, is that they don't have a lot of free templates and the ones that they offer aren't really that good.

I really like how simple it is to add a new product or remove a product. Also, I like how simple it is to change product descriptions and add pictures. Discounts are also easy to add at checkout. Also, I do find it simple to see sales based on location with Shopify. This is a feature that I use on a regular basis.","Ever since it was updated, it is much harder to use and more confusing for my staff to pull register reports. I also have found that the plug-ins are not as straight forward as they should be. We use AppCard and shippo plug-ins, but I am not thrilled with either.

Many of these affiliates wanted us to set up web stores they could send clients to, but each store needed to be branded to the affiliate, not to my company. So this was going to mean setting up multiple websites.
Shopify was the greatest. It's so easy to setup a site, and make it look professional. And for a web designer like myself, it's very easy to manipulate the CSS to get an even more personalized feel.","The credit card processing at the basic monthly price tier is more expensive than we'd like, and we don't do enough revenue with any 1 store to move up to the tier where we could integrate our normal processing.

While this is extraordinary for a few, it is awful for other people. They likewise don't have any underlying method to set up transportation dependent on item measurements so in the event that you have numerous items with various measurements this is presumably not the best site stage for you. Appears to be that we need to utilize many ""work arounds"" just to make things like transportation work. It very well may be a tremendous aggravation on the off chance that you have a major store."

Finally a modern online store software that is scaling with my business and introducing new features every single month. I love it.","What I love most about Shopify is that it is a truly user-friendly software without being too simple. I don't need technical or design skills to make a shop that does everything I need it to do and look sleek and professional. However, if I want to add my own pizazz, I have the option of HTML and CSS which gives me control over the templates and means I am not limited with their options. Moreover, I love that Shopify is a one-stop-shop; you don't need to buy web hosting or to install any special software, it's all done one their software. The bang for the buck is really high with Shopify as the SaaS model means you don't have to spend large upfront costs, and the monthly pricing is extremely fair. And most importantly, Shopify Payments is my favorite aspect of the software as I don't have to worry about transaction fees at all, and I don't have to deal with any other company should I have any issues. For anyone starting an online store, there's no better software than Shopify.","Though Shopify is mostly a one-stop-shop, I have been disappointed to find certain basic features require the installation of an app, such as reviews and ratings for my store, which has been a pain.

Back end code editor allows you to skip FTP or cPanel File Manager etc. For a managed software as a service product, it is top notch.",I am used to working with open source solutions such as Magento or other standalone software that I have 100% access to. It took a bit of adjustment in how I work (and frustration) to not be able to access code past the UI and API's but once I adapated I quickly could see the beauty in this easy to use platform.

If anything, once you figure it out, your website will have a polished and professional looking face which is really important to me.",IT IS SO HARD TO NAVIGATE THIS APP AND WEBSITE. I hate that I have to pay for templates that look so basic. And the templates that are free are so boxy and even more basic. Trying to personalize this website took me 4 days of on and off because it's not user friendly and written in simple terms for the unexperienced to understand. And customer support is no help at all.

Within a matter of days, we were able to import items into our online store so that we could start offering an e-commerce option for our customers. We were delighted about the ease of use, especially on the customer-facing side. We only need the basic tier of Shopify's tier options, which makes it extremely affordable for us. We highly recommend Shopify!","The learning curve can be quite steep if you're trying to import products into Shopify using the CSV upload process. The spreadsheet itself requires very specific things in order to import the products correctly. However, Shopify has a lot of great help articles that go through the spreadsheet needs line by line.

There apps for anything you might think of, starting from designing your store and going till managing and monitoring the performance, SEO tools, shippment tracking, email marketing, social media campaigns, everything is available to run succesful ecommerce store. Shopify customer service is very attentive and easy to reach.","You will need lots of apps and each app will cost additional fees, so intead of paying Shopify monthly basic plan 29$ you will end up paying 100$ if not more. Also those apps you are paying to get additional functionality of your store will affect the speed of your website, so you need to learn all that by trying them.
Another cons that you can build easily landing pages drug and drop, cant split test your pages. For that you need another apps like Zipify or Pagefly."

If you’re just getting started, the additional plugins you’ll need and help will make Wordpress and the Ali dropship plug-in look much more appetizing.","I appreciated that there was a high degree of customization available, multiple payment options - shop pay, Apple Pay, and the standards. I also think it’s a fast and optimizes your speeds page",There was very little support unless you pay for an expert. If I wasn’t in the ECX Academy I never could have gotten through shopify on my own. The support is terrible or costs you an arm and a leg.
Systems Administrator in Australia,", 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,"Best eCommerce solution for novice and pro - super easy to get started, awesome addons + all the back end support is taken care of.","We (my sister and I) are only a small boutique company with a dozen products. Having a background as a web developer (and a number of my own HTML & WordPress sites) it was my job to get the website sorted. We figured out that Shopify would only cost slightly more than a hosted e-commerce WordPress site PLUS with self-hosting, we'd still have to do all the backend stuff ourselves - so it was that trade-off of money for less stress. Security and ease of use were my biggest concerns and Shopify has taken care of that for me. The only other item we've purchased is a great theme to suit our range of products. We've not had to buy any additional apps/extensions as I've found some great free ones. Yes, there is a small fee involved with each transaction but this is comparable to other systems. No system is perfect so it's important to understand your market and your product and do your research on the various systems out there. But I'm a very happy Shopify fan! I wish you luck in your e-commerce journey.",Free 14 day trial lets you give it a go without committing; easier than woo or wordpress to setup and get started selling; great range of templates/themes and addon apps/extensions (free and paid); easy stock management; it's secure ; easy to design/customise your site - either as a developer using the code or just using the built in editor options.,I had to edit the code to insert my own meta keywords. But I may be old school when it comes to inserting keywords as I've also read that search engines don't necessarily worry about keywords anymore but focus on the content on the page.

And I'm impressed.
You are able to make a professional, aesthetically pleasing e-commerce store in a few hours. Less if you just want to use their pre-made templates and images. As someone who has little to no coding experience, I felt totally at use dragging and dropping to build a cohesive website. I actually think the planning took longer than actually putting all the pieces together.
I also appreciate that you can incorporate Shopify's features within your own website if you are just looking for the ""store"" component.
For a small business, I felt the monthly fees were on par with other competitors. Though I was not able to see if the fees would scale in my favour if my business took off.","There is a learning curve. I had many preset expectations on what Shopify did and how it did it based on my experiences with Squarespace, Wordpress, etc. which made the learning curve harder. But I believe that even someone with no experience building websites or an online store will catch up quickly.
What kind of got me was the feeling of being entrapped in Shopify's ecosystem. I know building an ecommerce site from scratch would be much much more expensive but I knew if I started with Shopify, it would be difficult to break up if/when the times came."
CEO in Mexico,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The only expense my shop has that I play gladly monthly.,"Ive been using Shopify for so many years.

Regarding the sales process, Shopify provides different payment options, including Shopify Payments, third-party payment gateways, and manual payments.

owner in Canada,"Internet, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,They think of just about everything,Great! I'll never recommend a different eComm platform.,"It seems like they've thought of everything. As a developer, I've set up eCommerce sites using Wordpress/WooCommerce, Wix, Volusion, and Shopify. Shopify has them all beat hands down ... price is great, setup is easy, plenty of styles to choose from, cazillions of apps, reasonable monthly price. Some other ecommerce sites are a bit cheaper but the functionality or ease of use just isn't there.",I have worked with Shopify sites for several years and I feel like the Shopify Basic plan is getting more basic. It seems like many new features that get developed require one of the higher plans ... which is understandable but also unfortunate; considering the start-up nature of many Shopify businesses. I think it'd be cool if the more expensive plans where cheaper for a 6 month period while the store (hopefully) gets up and running.

From selling physical products, to customized ones, or even drop-shipping, everything is just made easy with Shopify. Everything is complete, and can be done within the Shopify system.","I would probably say that I didn't like how changing the themes and widgets weren't so beginner-friendly. You'd need to be a bit knowledgeable in code to tweak the existing themes. Not that the themes they have aren't good, but sometimes, you just want to change it up a bit, so that's just the only issue I have."

Some pitches even revolve around the fact that integration is made simple because of the flexibility Shopify offers…meaning more and more companies are starting to see the partnership possibilities two companies can have simply by having this software.","For the most part, I utilize Shopify every day. And what I like most about it, is ease of it. I can go into the software one day and upload a new location without it taking me half an hour to do so…coming from someone who isn’t a coder, that is a great time saver.",No cons that comes to mind. Every software can improve but Shopify is always looking into ways they can improve and are usually ahead of the “problem” before I can even recommend it.
Marketing specialist in Canada,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Great ecommerce platform with ease of use,If you are looking to move an ecommerce platform I believe shopify is the best option,There are so many applications which you can integrate to the platform to automate your business and many of them are free,I wish there was easier was to manage ads from.the shopify platform.

We switched to Shopify and his bookstore after set up and management has created more profit.",The site customization is not as easy as some well know companies like Wix or Squarespace when it comes to creating an all-inclusive website.
freelancer in Philippines,"Writing & Editing, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify-able: An all-in-One Online Store,"I personally like the app because it will help to publish my product and make more profit. The interface of the apps is easy and the word shopify is already giving hints what is app for. In my experienced of using this app, I will use it more once more user will install in their phone and use it regularly for their online shopping.",This app is very good in terms of daily usability in managing your e-commerce management. The app is already in the google play store and have low memory and is easy to download. I use other online stores but I can say that this is better than other apps because of the different services offered by the apps. The editing of the brand and product that you want to purchase is better. I highly recommend this app to my friends and family because it is a friendly user.,There is a need for more attention from the customers once I put up an online store. I still need to advertise more to attract customers to my Shopify. Although it is easy to use I need more advertisements and invitations to the customer to grab our product. Maybe having a partner with the other well know platforms will invite more use to this application.
Sales in Canada,"Telecommunications, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,A ready to go store in no time,"Overall if I don't want to waste time exploring different plugins and I have a following or a pr-established presence or a good budget its good to use this platform, because you can start ruining really quickly, but if you are experienced in content management systems you can create your own with ease.","- It is easy to set up and to use
- The back end user interface is modeled like WordPress, it has the same look and feel
- There is a lot of support from the Shopify team if you ever get stuck you will be able to get a hold of someone that can help you, has documentation and manuals
- Its easy to figure out how to set up payment options, add products and has shipping options available for you to easily print shipping labels for sending your merchandise.
- You can easily customize the look with the free themes included in the platform.
- They have a 15 days free trial if you have a solid launching plan with followers you can make your monthly payment within the first week since setting up the store is easy and quick.
- Security is taken care of.","- The price is OK, but $29 to $179 a month not the most economic coming from other platforms like WordPress I know I can do the same for less money.
- You have to use their platform to have a store, you can't migrate it any ware else so its their platform or nothing. Once you are started, the only way to migrate is to do it slowly but it takes time."
Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,Gift Card Needs,"I have used this platform for two different businesses. While It's not my favorite to use in terms of design, it does offer extensive ecom features.","For my business, I need to be able to issue specific unique gift certificate amounts. This was the only service I found that had enough flexibility with its gift card features to allow me to do that.","I wish the actual webpage for my online shop was easier to customize and make more aesthetically pleasing. It's not an ugly website, but it's rather basic."

Marketing Director in US,"Health, Wellness & Fitness, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Could Implement Other Features,They have good customer service. They communicate well. I like Shopify. I just wish it could do more.,The ease of use is great! For someone with very little web experience that may want to start their own online ecommerce platform I would recommend Shopify!,There needs to be more focus on adding features from Shopify. Right now you have to download so many apps to customize your store in the way you would want to. Want to offer stacked discounts? Nope. Want subscriptions? Nope. You have to purchase monthly subscriptions to apps that may not work in harmony together. Some of the apps that I subscribe to could easily be implemented by Shopify as a feature of the site.
"Real Estate, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,4.0,Good Out of Box E-commerce Solution,Shopify has helped me get many clients off the ground quickly while leaving them with an easy-to-use platform to grow on their own.,"For the casual business person, this is a great solution for e-commerce. I have dealt with large companies who use Magento or OpenCart to small Etsy shop owners who need a boutique solution. Shopify is powerful but better suited for those who need to get online fast. Like WordPress, the theme library is exponentially growing every day to provide design options to the point of being overwhelming. But in the age of form over function, this is only helpful for someone who needs to present themselves well and figure out the ""how"" later.","I don't like the rigidity of Shopify's domain registry and hosting solutions. If you ever need to move your cart away from Shopify, you will find an endless loop of hurdles to gain back control of your domain or hosting. It's the same with Squarespace. I understand why there's very little peaking under the hood with their integration, but it's annoying when you want to ""do more"" with your online presence by moving to a more powerful platform. I recommend registering your domain and hosting elsewhere and integrating them with the Shopify platform for ""down the road"" flexibility."

Moreover, you can't sell products coming from different stocks places."
Director of Sales and Marketing in US,"Sporting Goods, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Solid ecommerce platform,Shopify has been the best Ecommerce platform we have used to date,Ease of use. Everything is simply placed and learned. Functions are all top notch. The backside interface is most important to us.,"It's reporting could be better, when creating custom reports. No ability to merge accounts. Has trouble reserving items for draft orders"
Founder in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,The best and easiest solution to small business ecommerce.,"I'm a small business owner, selling lifestyle jewelry and photography services on two Shopify sites. It allows me to process credit cards, PayPal payments, create inventory lists, shipping labels, tax forms, and more all from one single dashboard. It's not a cheap solution, but if you have any sort of business volume you'll quickly cover your annual costs. I've been using Shopify for several years and just recently took a break, but I have no doubt that when I'm ready to relaunch I'll be renewing with Shopify to revamp my websites and start making money again. There really is no other or better option - the competition is more expensive and at a lower quality.","Creating a website, stocking product, and launching my store was so incredibly simple. I customized a pre-made template with custom colors and a custom typeface, made a mobile version, and then logged my inventory is just a few hours. I now have two Shopify sites!","The gallery views and hover-over animations are a bit limited. I wish I could combine the drag-and-drop customization of Wix with the ecommerce power of Shopify. Right now, I'm just filling in text blocks and the template dictates what goes where. If you can work within those confines you're set, but if you want more freedom like I do you may get frustrated at times."
owner in Slovakia,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Best tool to start your online business,I like shopify they have great support that can help you if you have any issues.,Its easy to use and to create your shop. Its easyer then wordpress. If you wanna quickly build a ecommerce I would suggest shopify.,The weird thing is that they charge for every sale your store generates. So it can get pricy when you sell a lot.
Owner in US,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Great option for a starter online business.,Overall Shopify has been 100% my go to for any burned I start. It's the best for beginners and can be grown to help you thrive.,"What I like most about Shopify is it's so easy to use, customize, and learn to grow my image to help support my brand. Very good web builder, easy shopping carts and I love the fraud detector.","The only complaint I have about Shopify is the price, I feel they could charge less and still profit."
Owner in US,"Retail, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify Rocks like no other,Shopify has been an awesome essential tool for my business. It has saved so much money for my company and is really easy to use.,"Okay there is so much positive about Shopify. You can save yourself so much money by doing it yourself and the add-ons that most would probably use are very inexpensive or free. There is so much to add on and it's not just for product based stores, it can help tremendously with brick and mortar stores, especially with Facebook. Also the ability to connect other sales channels is priceless. Also with PayPal, Stripe and Amazon Pay integrated already, no need to pay for these add-ons like others.",The only thing that I can say bad about it is that some add-ons can be pretty trashy so do your homework and research on them before signing up with add-ons. They are not regulated by Shopify that much and all.
Director of Strategic and New Development in South Africa,"Computer Software, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Great if you do not know how to code,"While Shopify is not perfect, its a great place to start if having a eCommerce site feels a little overwhelming. With great security, polished code and expert developer support available, its really easy to get going fast.","Their security is tight, and chances of your shop being hacked is virtually impossible.
They are well supported, and have a long history of providing great integration with other services.
Although you will have to learn how the interface and backend works, you do not need to know how to write code itself.
If you want something that requires coding, there are many shopify developers out there.
Really easy to set up a payment option and they cover all the basic needs well.","Almost all of the good plugins come as a monthly rental, not a once of cost. This leads to increased costs, if you want something that is not natively available in shopify.
Support is average, and you often have to explain problems in great detail.
Their interface and backend could me more modern and intuitive, as more robust code is now available. This would make it easier to design and build a store."
general director in Burkina Faso,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,my shopify review,,,
"Consumer Goods, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,Reviewer Source,5.0,Recommended E-commerce Platform,"Shopify is a very user-friendly site and it's a good way to get started dropshipping. I like how easy it is to track customers and take orders. It has some really great features but I wouldn't rule out other platforms, such as Wordpress. It has everything you need to start an E-commerce business.","This is a good platform to use if you have no prior experience developing websites. It is very popular for dropshippers and it is a relatively cheap business to start. All you have to do is have a vision, provide a name for your store and you can create the Shopify layout quickly and easily to your liking. There is a ton of work with an E-commerce business and Shopify makes it significantly more manageable. They have a great support team that you can contact 24/7.","There are a lot of apps that you may have to consider purchasing which will increase the monthly store price. I don't know much about coding and I regularly have to contact support when downloading new apps because they don't show up on my store immediately. This is probably not going to affect new stores, just make sure you don't mess with the code too much or you might have problems like this."
Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Best eCommerce & Point of Sale software,I wholeheartedly recommend Shopify.,Shopify is a great all-around system for managing sales both in-store (point of sale) and online. It is intuitive and easy to use.,"Box sizes are not easily configured for shipping, which can lead to inaccurate calculated shipping rates for online customers."
Founder in US,"Media Production, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Perfect for Ecommerce Stores,I'm really happy with my experience on shopify and would recommend it to other people running online stores.,"I have been using shopify to run my ecommerce store for a while now and it has been a huge help! It's really easy to create a website, process orders, manage inventory, and do everything else you need right on shopify. No major complaints!","It can get a bit expensive once you start adding third-party apps, premium themes, etc. Overall, you get what you pay for though."
Founder in India,"Marketing & Advertising, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: Free Trial,3.0,Shopify: Best E-commerce Platform to sell large number of products.,"If you need to sell more than 1,000 products, Shopify is the best option, but for fewer items, Wordpress is the best option because it allows us to do a lot of things as compared to Shopify.","Shopify offers over 100 mobile-friendly designs for website design. It offers a financial dashboard where you can track your sales and revenues. The dashboard allows us to easily track product orders.
You will receive unlimited bandwidth after purchasing any Shopify subscription (which can accommodate an endless amount of website visits). It includes marketing and SEO tools. Because numerous payment gateway interfaces may be implemented, you should have no issue collecting money from your clients.
Additionally, the 24/7 customer assistance is available if you have any questions about utilising Shopify.","Shopify is not recommended for SEO because it was intended as an e-commerce platform rather than a generic website platform.
We can only set three product attributes in Shopify: size, colour, and material.
Furthermore, because the data is kept on Shopify, we are unable to save a backup of your website.
And if we want to customise our site by changing the templates, we'll need to hire a web designer who understands the ""Liquid"" programming language.
The most significant consideration before utilising Shopify is that we cannot easily migrate the blog from another web development platform(like Squarepsace, Wordpress) . Migrating to Shopfy is really challenging."

The integration features it has are impressive, because you can do anything from integrating buttons into Pinterest posts, to selling T-Shirts that are printed automatically by someone else at a factory and then automatically shipped to people,... it's super flexible and powerful. I use it for two of my online stores!","The setup time on it is a little long for my taste, but it's probably because I am not as familiar yet with setting up Shopify sites as I am with other technologies.... however, once it's setup it's really, really easy to use!"
COO in South Africa,"Airlines/Aviation, 201–500 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify! Are we doing this?,"Profitable, seemless, pleasant and enjoyable.

To answer my question: Are we doing this ? We sure are! Keep up the good work Shopify!","E-commerce is an ever growing business these days and Shopify is possibly the best known e-commerce platform offering solutions for this industry. Shopify has a wide range of themes on offer, that go a long way in allowing me to create my online store with ease. It is easy to use for beginners and offers a choice of different price plans to subscribe to their platform. Shopify is utilised by millions of merchants and provides services to over 4 million online stores. With such great numbers, i can be confident that Shopify is here to stay and i can trust their business model, which works great! Clearly it is hugely scalable and global, adding to my desired experience. I can interact with my customers using the Shopify inbox messaging service, which is great for marketing and the growth of my business. Love the customer support -very helpful and efficient! Easy to use, affordable- don't need to sell a kidney to get started and a mobile phone or a laptop with internet connection will be needed. Simple, isn't it!","I thought the trasnaction fees were a bit high in comparison to other providers of similar services. Other than that, i am a satisfied Shopifyer!"

Shopify was able to justify all requirements of the client within his budget.,"Shopify is budget-friendly, SEO optimized, easy to set up, and the most reliable Store builder product. It helps you to build the website of your store where your customers can engage with the product range that you provide. I loved Shopify in its capacity.","There are a lot of features that other alternatives like Magento and Wix are providing these days, CMS with a working cart and e-commerce model should have modules for email marketing to run campaigns. Betterment can be brought here in add-ons. But, so far so good, I don't feel it lacks in any of the necessary aspects."
"Retail, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,The only tool you need for a successful ecommerce business.,"I've set up multiple Shopify stores for clients and myself. I love how easy it is to use. Even if you're never worked with an eCommerce platform, you'll understand a majority of the system within an hour or two. I cannot recommend it enough.","I've been in the eCommerce industry for over 15 years. Shopify is the perfect platform for any business. Whether you're just starting out or doing over $1 million a year already, Shopify will work for you. It's easy to get started. Everything you need is included out of the box but in the rare instance you need something else, the Shopify App story is likely to have exactly what you need.",The only thing I would say could be improved is the Discounts section. You're not able to stack discounts and there's not too many options for custom discounts. That's a very minor issue though that can be resolved with the right app.
Owner in US,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,The best for e-commerce!,It's perfect for anyone wanting to start an e-commerce business.

There are so many features and it's very user-friendly. I love that I can integrate other apps into it to make running my store much more easily.,There isn't anything that I dislike about Shopify.

It is a bit expensive but the versatility and speed at which we can ship is not something we could do without.,"The versatility of tracking order flow is outstanding. We can see time, product selection, payment verification, shipping and tracking data at hand. Analysis of operations is in extreme detail which gives us the information needed to adjust our advertising spend to target new markets.",There are some sort functions that would be nice to have such as segmenting customer lists to identify auto-ship and customers who have ordered multiple times. Sorting some customer data by city or state names can produce results that are not within the field of inquiry. Sorting customers in West Virginia for example with show customers in Virginia and customers who's name is Virginia.

If you are looking to setup a online store, shopify gives you all the tools you need to create your store in a few minutes.","I started my business last year and shopify has been of great help! First of all, it's really easy to setup the account. I love that they give you a 14 day trial just so you can check out how to manage the whole store. The monthly payment are not high also, the price is ok. I was able to add my products really fast and also with the help of the integration of apps like printful, oberlo and others you can sell products more easily and ship them fast.

For an extremely reasonable monthly fee, creating an online store has never been more of a steal.","As a web design & developer, I have worked on many projects involving the Shopify platform, and I have nothing but good things to say about it. Creating stores with it makes life easier for me, my client, and the customer.
Picking/editing themes, uploading products, creating collections, and customizing pages are all made easy for the client. This saves the developer so much time to not have to create this functionality for them, it's all built right in. Every business I work with loves the ability to edit things without hassle and Shopify executes that perfectly.
For developers, editing the code of themes goes smoothly and hassle free using Shopify's main built in front-end language, Liquid. It's a powerful language that opens the door to endless opportunities with it's ability to display information, create dynamic variables, and much more. Learning Liquid will greatly increase the power a developer can have to help the customer use the store with ease.","A Shopify grows rapidly, some days the platform will go down due to busy server load, but very briefly.

I think the website features are absolutely adequate and more than enough for most businesses, and they're beautiful and modern and responsive. All in all I don't have any real complaints about the platform, I just end up choosing open source solutions most of the time.","The main reason we select Shopify for clients is if they sell their products both online AND in person (either in a brick and mortar store or at expos / markets). The inventory syncing for those different points of sale is top of the industry. Also, love that they have so many integrations with popular software like Quickbooks.","I'm a fan of open source software, and Shopify is closed source. That means lots of things, but specifically for my preferences I don't love that when you want to 'do' something that needs an extension (WordPress calls them plugins, Shopify calls them Apps), there is sometimes only one or two choices, and rarely are they free. Also there are limitations to the customization available with the website's appearance itself unless you learn a specific coding language which of course most users won't."

It's a very powerful eCommerce platform and we made up to $30K a month in our eCommerce business - and our business was mentioned on Forbes.

In the beginning, it was difficult for me to navigate but once I got a grip on it, it became a breeze.","Shopify is by far the best E-commerce Platform I have had to use to build webshops for my Small business clients. I particularly find it beneficial, the ability to customize your shop to suit your need even though you must have coding skill to do this. It is perfect for drop shipping. Shopify made it easy for me to migrate from another woo-commerce platform to them with all my contents intact!
You will have to pay a Shopify expert for the migration if you don’t know how to do it.
The inventory and product management in Shopify is quite easy to use and a piece of cake for new users.
The worries of maintaining a hosting service for your client is eliminated because your shop is hosted on their platform and the SEO is excellent. They have very good customer support.","I think that shopify pricing is really expensive for shops with low traffic as you may end up with no profit after paying your monthly fees. Also, the Shopify’s built-in payment system is not available in some countries which means you have to spend extra to integrate a 3rd party payment system.
Many of the free themes from shopify are almost useless if you lack coding skills.
If you have no technical knowledge of woo commerce, your learning curve will be steep due to no fault of theirs."

It is a very nice feature because it gives you time to try out the software, check out the tools, and decide if you like it enough to pay for it after.

It is a very great tool for those looking to get their foot in the door in e-commerce. Lets you start an online business for a decent price.","Honestly, I was not happy with the customer service. I had a small issue with something, and first of all the person on the other side of the phone is in a foreign country with a very thick accent, so it was very difficult to understand what she was trying to say. I kept telling her my problem, and she just kept repeating what I had just told her. I really didn't get the help I needed, I had to look it up online and finally found a solution for it."

And it generally takes a while to load when trying to find orders, I think the search feature could be quicker.

1-Customize topic utilizing own PHP language
Shopify stage utilizes their self-created PHP language called ""Fluid"".
All subjects are coded in this organization. It makes subject customization harder except if you know how to code in Liquid or will recruit a designer who knows how to code Shopify topics.
A few Shopify surveys from engineers notice that Liquid is a simple to-learn language however actually I feel awkward playing with the code.
Except if you need to alter subject center records, then, at that point, you're protected off staying with their prebuilt ones.
Then again, you can decide on an exceptional subject with help rather to try not to any code issues."

Also, I appreciate the many features offered by the software that are often organized logically and intuitively.","Overall, the Shopify software has very few flaws.

Developer in UK,"Computer Software, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,Super easy ecommerce solution with templating for advanced users,Sometimes clients want a minimum viable eCommerce solution - something which Shopify is very good at doing.,The templates system that lets more advanced users customize the look and feel of the site. If you are a developer who needs to set up an online shop on a budget this is by far the best solution. If you aren't a developer there is a large theme store.,Theme store is a bit expensive and if you do buy a theme you risk having your shop look exactly the same as another random shop online. Obviously this is to be expected if you are buying off-the-shelf themes but it is something to bear in mind if you or your client is sensitive about branding.

Owner in US,"Arts & Crafts, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,5.0,"One of the best online shopping sites, if you already have a customer base.","I used Shopify when I first started my small craft business. I set up my shop, all my listings, and my business details. It was a great experience, and super easy for a first-time small business owner to use.","Shopify is one of the most well-known online web-store options out there. It's one of the first sites that anyone thinks of when they start looking to setup an online shop. The pricing is fair. The ability to have a custom url address is fantastic for branding reasons. It's extremely easy to use and quick to set up. The features are all detailed and easy to learn. The layout and look are appealing, and they really help your shop start off looking great. Overall, Shopify is a great choice for anyone who is looking to open up an online business. There are plenty of competitors, but you owe it to yourself to give Shopify a try.","The main downside to Shopify is that you have to advertise your shop yourself. If you don't have a customer base or following already built, then it's going to take some time before you start seeing any progress or sales. You have to post, share, tell others, and get the word out to help others find your shop. I opened up my first online shop with Shopify, but I had just started out so I didn't even have that many social media followers. So it took a whole lot of time, patience, and hard work to start getting views in my shop. Based on the pricing and the amount of work that I had to put in, I decided that it made more sense to start on a site with its own following already, Etsy, so that I could get at least a few views while I built up my social media followers. Shopify is great if you have people who are looking for your shop, but if you're just starting out, just realize that it will take some time and work to be found."

It's simple to use, which makes it ideal for collaborating with other departments within the shop.","I like the user interface since it's simple to read and evaluate, and it doesn't take up a lot of time for someone who is just getting started with website development. Shopify allows you to put your ideas into action right now. Stores can be set up in a matter of minutes thanks to the modular design. The current payment module may be set up, and apps for analysis, marketing, and aesthetics can be deployed. The foundation may be established fast, especially for e-commerce beginners with little history in web design, and the visible development in success stimulates to keep going. Anyone who enjoys Pareto and wants to go from point A to point B fast would like Shopify!","You face the danger of creating a store that looks like any other' due to Shopify's simple operation and now broad use. Structure and fundamental structures are always quite similar, and to stand out from the crowd, code changes are required. Custom coding, especially for newbies, can be intimidating, necessitating the use of commercial tools or the consulting of expert web developers if something ""special"" is required. Integration proved challenging, despite the fact that they have some excellent in-house integrations, or perhaps they require a more experienced programmer."

It has all the essentials that a shop needs, and I know it can achieve all layouts and functionality. It has great range of plugins that do really amazing things that spice up your website. Its all very user friendly.","Shopify's power comes from the powerful library of external tools and plugins, and thats the key to fully transforming your site to a powerhouse. At the same time, it is these stack of tools, that quickly ramp up your monthly bill. Whilst you're actively developing the site further, its great. Once you're done and let your site sit idle and do its thing... you need to deactivate alot of plugins to save cost - which then limits you to go back to 'touch up a few things', knowing you have to reactivate tools, and cough up another monthly tool subscription, just for at times small changes. Its either that or - your website is fully dependent on the plugin, and you are locked in for life to pay that extra bill, often more expensive than Shopify's subscription.
I rely on many other external Website Builder tools . Having a powerful one built into Shopify would be a life saver."

4. Besides subscription, it charges you for payment processing, transaction fees, additional tools, taxes, and so on. You got to be careful with your budget.
5. It is typical to set up Google analytics on Shopify. So keep your training ante up!

There hasn't been an issue with our site that has gone unsolved.","Coming from Magento, the Shopify User Interface was immediately a step in the right direction. It's intuitiveness and ease of learning is second to none. Shopify's Liquid language and incredible repository of knowledge makes entry-level coding and customizing a breeze.","While Shopify is certainly powerful right out of the box, it doesn't take long to discover some specific needs that aren't provided, that require third party apps to achieve. While the app store is chock full of great apps, most of them aren't very cheap, and require a monthly subscription, which adds to the Shopify bill."

It is easy to get started and integrates so well with so many other platforms such as email and advertising such as Facebook ads.,"The main cons are the lack of ability to customise areas like the Checkout, unless you were on on a very high-end plan which does start getting expensive, though the first two pricing levels are very affordable and enough for most people to get started on."

However, because it does allow for a lot of customization (even editing back end code), it isn't the simplest CMS available. Depends on your needs really!","- Great customizability
- Lots of plugins available, will always find a plugin for something you need","- Not the easiest to use
- Customizing shipping is difficult and limited without a paid plan"
Customer Service Agent in UK,"Consumer Services, 10,000+ Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Shopify is a great E-commerce solution.,"Shopify is a great product, with a very good community which makes it often easy to resolve any issues you may experience online.",I like how basic and cleanly designed Shopify is. It's also great that you do not require any previous knowledge of this type of program previously as you can use some pre-made templates for the shops you wish to create. My favorite feature about Shopify is that you can have shipping integration with multiple courier services as an add-on. This makes sorting orders much easier to organise and assure all the necessary steps have been done to prepare for shipping etc.,Most of the add-ons to enhance this software are paid options and require a monthly payment or fee.

Reports are great, customization is robust, and totally secure. Perfect for getting a store online.",Speed and load times are fast. Secure and reasonable cost for hosting package.

Proprietary coding requires time to learn. Initial setup process is cumbersome if you're short on time but seems that each new version gets easier.

You can have your e-commerce up and running in a couple of hours if you don't need something too specific. They have a very good universe of apps, themes and developers that help you when you need something more specific.
They integrate very well with a lot of third parties systems, marketplaces, accounting software, and more.
Support team is always there to help you and they even go further to coach you.
There is also an API to work with if you need to.","When you start getting specific is a little annoying to have to pay for some features that seem basics, and some third party apps charge you for.
Shopify does not list your products to eBay Motors (important for us), and the listing to Amazon wasn't easy for us.
The learning curve on the coding part (you don't need to, but if you want to change something in the layout that the theme doesn't allow to, it's useful) is stiff."
"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,Reviewer Source,2.0,Not the best,It’s a service for people who want to learn to build they’re own website.

It was easy to sign up and get started. That’s when it basically went wrong.,"There’s way, way way too many options for a “do it yourself” web builder.

Once you comprehend the fundamentals of tagging, errors can be corrected with ease, and cataloging is simple. The provided themes are simple to use and change. The customer support line is always open, A very smart choice is to move from amazon, whose policies are always changing.",The costs AND a charge for each transaction. uses a unique script or language rather than standardized coding. (Liquid). does not allow for file uploads through WebDAV or FTP. only permits the import and export of the most basic product information without the usage of third-party software. relies on third-party apps to provide capabilities that other carts come with by default. Cannot alter the checkout procedure; must follow their recommendations. poor controls for SEO.

For absolute beginners, Shopify is a great place to upload a decent theme in order to start selling products. The company is client-centered and I love how it incubates the feedback from its own users to help them continuously grow.","Variants appear in Facebook marketplaces. 1 product that appears in 3 colors will appear as 3 separate listings when selling on the social media platform. Some of its integrations with 3rd party plugins and themes can be a bit wonky as well, but it's understandable."

You can do a lot without programming.","What I like the least is that if you don’t use ShopifyPayment they charge you 2% when a customers buys you a product, that’s fine when you can decide to use it or not, but in my case, in my Country (Panamá) they don’t offer ShopifyPayment so I don’t have more option that use a third party payment hub, so I’m paying per each sale a 2% + the fee of the third party payment hub."

It's also easy to integrate your stock from other marketplaces and they've thought of pretty much everything you could ever need. Very easy to add new stock and adjust prices as well as integrating payment processors.","My only issue with shopify, and it's a tiny one, is that not all payment processors are supported, the majority of mainstream ones are, but if you use something less known, it probably won't be there."
Travel Writer in US,"Writing & Editing, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,"Highly Functional for Commerce, But Other Options Exist","Shopify is slick and can work very well for some brands. But I found that if content marketing is a huge element of how you attract new customers, you should either consider Shopify plus Wordpress, or Wordpress with WooCommerce.","The fact is, Shopify is a top tier choice when adding e-commerce to your website. It's easy to add inventory, intuitive for users on both sides, and it just works.","Clients with an e-commerce brand recently switched their site from a custom CMS to Shopify. Against my recommendation they also moved the site's Wordpress blog onto Shopify, and the results have been disastrous for traffic to the blog (which far outperformed the e-commerce site and was an excellent lead magnet). The blog has hemorrhaged traffic in the months since the move, and shed many page 1 rankings, including nearly all of the site's featured snippets. It's just not a robust blogging platform and isn't intended to be. But in this day and age, with the importance of content market and DTC marketing, having poor content options isn't ideal."

It provides you many free plugins and some paid also, but the money you paid over there is worth it. Designing your own store is a very fun thing when you are doing it on Shopify.","Although this software solves a lot of problems, the biggest problem for me is the payment system. I am from India and I am an engineering student, so I do not have any credit card or Paypal account, I have only my Rupay debit card, and that is not applicable over there, but I think only a small percentage of people face this issue but I am one of them so I mentioned about it."

They have a lot of different options for different budgets, which I really appreciate. The software is also very easy to learn, so creating your website and products descriptions is a breeze. However, what makes Shopify stand out the most is their customer service. It is by far the most amazing customer service I have ever experienced. I love to do things myself but am not a great learner from videos so I have called customer service A LOT and no matter what time of day or who I get, they provide the most amazing, patient, helping, and supportive customer service I have every seen.","My only complaint with Shopify is that is hard to tell what the final product will look like on your website. How the product appears on the Shopify page is not exactly how it looks from your website. However, it doesn't effect sales in a negative way, it is just a personal thing."

Need it fast? This is where you need to be. Need something custom or unique? You're looking at more enterprise-grade solutions (one of which, to be fair, Shopify makes).","Shopify is SUPER easy to spin up. You can theoretically get fancy with it, but that's not our typical use case. Instead, if a client needs a store in a month or less, it's almost always Shopify. Buy a plan, import your SKUs and launch. It's really that easy.","Customization is tough. You're often going with third-party apps, some of which can be buggy. Plus, they can get expensive fast. Your $20ish/month plan gets to $50 or more fast when you need to customize things."

Location Planner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Makes Running a Small Business Doable,"Overall I really don't think I could have chosen a better web tool to host my business.

Whether you are new to building a website or have years of experience, Shopify works for everyone.","I love all of the app extensions that can be downloaded to help with just about anything I could want. From dropshipping and wholesale to advertising and marketing help, there is literally just about anything you could want with Shopify!",I dislike having to have a more expensive plan just to utilize gift cards in my business. Having gift cards for sell could be a huge advantage for many small businesses but having the higher paid plan isn't always justifiable especially in the beginning. I'd love to see this feature become available on all plans.
Direct in UK,"Retail, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,4.0,Great plateform,"Overall very happy with the Shopify, especially after moving form Magento, which is a great platform too but you to employ a Magento developer to use it well.",Easy to use with lots of optional apps to add functionality. Definitely the platform to use if you want to able to run your own ecommerce shop with little programming ability. It has plenty of integration possibilities too which works great with our POS systems.,It can start to get quite expensive once you add a lot of paid apps. Also the standard themes are a bit basic so you do have to purchase the better ones from 3rd party developers which then means Shopifys customer help centre can't always o much to help with any layout issues.

It simplified our sales process, gave us real time data on sales in an easy to digest manner, and has increased our ability to tie ad spend to revenue and have interplay between those two.","As a marketing professional, getting access to our shopify has been a game-changer. Being able to see the analytics and deep dive into the reports has drastically increased the connection between ad spend and revenue generated—a must for anyone running online ads if you don't want to waste money. It's also helped us identify areas of opportunity with certain products that have sold well despite having no advertising dollars behind them—and allowed us to capitalize on that.","It only supports one Facebook store, which is tough for us, as we manage multiple accounts under one master brand. Not the biggest issue, but would be nice to add more capability on that front."

I love that it is integrating with other platforms to ensure that one can have one network of everyone from one hub.,On occasion I’ve noticed that Shopify goes off so my website is not reachable and myshopify.com is also not reachable.

I would recommend this product to anyone trying to start an online store/presence that is limited on time or e-commerce ability.","• Easy to create a nice looking online store.
• Analytics are great. They tell you the number of visitors to your store, what they are looking at, if anyone added things to their cart, etc.
• Great built-in remarketing abilities. When someone begins the checkout process but does not complete it, you can set it up to send them a follow-up email to complete their purchase. (Caveat, this only works if they input their email address during the checkout process.)
• Email capabilities to shoppers with built-in automation that is easy to set up.
• Online stores are mobile ready and look great on mobile devices.
• Simple connectivity to social media.
• End-user (customer experience) is very smooth through the online store.

A great starting solution AND it's owned by Amazon so it has a solid backing and insight into their ecomm expertise.
Has solid integrations like Shopping Cart Abandonment to help clients maximize ecomm opportunities and driving revenue.","I don't see the platform going away but this is a hosted solution so it's a non-open source platform that is subject to their features and functions, which is good to keep costs low but you are subject to their limitations.

US,"Consumer Electronics, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,A Great Solution To Online Sales,"Opening our Shopify store was an absolute breeze! Prior to Shopify, we were selling on a custom site and platform that we had built, including a handful of integrations with Cloudflare, Celery, and Google Analytics. It was incredibly cumbersome to manage and maintain, as our site was very image-rich (product photos, demonstrations, etc.) and trying to serve that content at scale led to a constant juggling act with Cloudflare to keep our image caches correctly updated when content changed. By the time we were all said and done, we were spending 3-4x a monthly subscription to Shopify to keep the site afloat. Fast forward to now - our site is highly available around the globe and has integrations with many major sales platforms (Apple Pay, Messenger, Facebook Pages, etc.) and support has become trivial - Shopify's administrative panel makes it super simple to get order and customer information quickly. Coupling these features with the iOS app, it's allowed me to get out from my office and engage the rest of our team without worrying that I might be missing something!",,

The [SENSITIVE CONTENT HIDDEN] wanted to add in functionality that wasn't standard, so he brought in a freelance programmer who quickly turned the site into a giant mess. The entire thing had to be rebuilt from scratch. That said, there are so many templates to choose from, rebuilding the site wasn't too terribly difficult. It's worth the investment (to me) to buy a good template and stick within its bounds. If that's not possible because your business' needs are too complex, then it's probably better to go a different route. But for simple ecommerce, it's a wonderful way to quickly set up a professional site.","If you can find a template that works for your site, then this is an ideal to quickly create a polished, functional ecommerce site. It's well-known enough to integrate with most popular add-ons and is fairly easy to use.","If your company needs something beyond what's offered in a template, you'll need to hire a programmer, and if you don't find a good programmer, the code can get messy in a hurry."

You'll always need extra, additional apps to juice up the feature-set of your online store.
I also REALLY dislike their coding language, .liquid. It makes everything twice as complex as it needs to be and doubles/triples costs of having folks come in and work on your site."

This software, help us assist customer faster and we are able to find an order with out the order number, just with basic info.","What I like the most about this platform, is that we are able to merged any information from Shopify to another platform (Gorgias, aircall). This make our life more easy. We are able to find all the customer information with one click.",I love everything about this software so far.

You can setup and open your online store in a few hours, and start operating it (even successfully, with PPC campaigns) in 1 day.","Many users think that is enough to set-up a store with Shopify and you'll start making money.
That's quite a big mistake: you need to consider what type of marketing campaigns you'll run, what's your niche, how to make your offers appealing and much more.
Shopify should notify this at anyone who's getting started."
"Computer Software, 501–1,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,4.0,Best Ecommerce Site Builder Out There,"Love it and do not plan at all leaving Shopify now ,or in the far future.","The ease of use in creating a website is phenomenal. You can build a decent, high quality website with little to no experience in coding or design in a matter of hours. The integrations between Shopify and advertising platforms such as Google Adsense, Facebook Blueprint, and others are major time savors and crucial for business. Payment processing both online or in store are made a breeze. In practically every capacity specific to e=commerce Shopify is king.","Wix, a competitor, arguably offers more features for creating your own UNIQUE looking website- I like A&B testing, so I enjoyed that aspect of wix (However, understand that your website will look GOOD on Shopify, and in literally every other capacity Shopify is superior)"

Any changes you make to the site show up online as soon as you hit ""save"". Being able to use Shopify shipping discounts is a plus.","Setting up the shipping and estimating shipping costs accurately is a bit of a nuisance.

Shopify easily integrates with many sales channels so you can keep everything in one dashboard and don't have to manage several channels manually.,"The things I like most about Shopify is how easy it is to get started and use. Setting up an online store can be tedious and time consuming, but Shopify makes it easy. I like how many apps they offer to install and add to your store to make it meet all the needs you may have. They also have valuable analytics that provide projections and suggestions too. You're able to brand everything and customize to really make it your own.","There's not much to dislike, but I would say their version of coding might be a hassle, but fortunately they have great customer service that are always very helpful and can assist you with whatever you are trying to do, otherwise there are a ton of applications you can add to your store that do the work for you too, when it comes to adding special features to your store."

The customer support is very good and all issues are resolved swiftly.,"The interface is good and the dashboard is very well designed, it helps the customers to search for products easily. We can promote our brands by selling the products and growing our businesses. We can build various sections with different categories of products and customize them. The search/filter works really well and help customers to find the relevant items easily.",The application keeps getting expensive the more you add features to it. There are not many customisation options available when building the website. It lacks integration with many other platforms and brands.

You can have your online store launched with a free template within 30 mins.,"The POS is not updated for countries that don’t use penny’s. This is tricky when your making cash transactions as it doesn’t provide to appropriate amount for change and your float is off. Also, why do we have to pay a Canadian company in US dollars? It doesn’t make sense for us Canadians’s. Lastly when using the Canada post system, when you void the transaction it’s credited as USD, how does this work?"

I have minimal web development skills but Shopify was so seamless to use that it didn’t matter. It’s extremely user friendly!,Not all apps blend with the Shopify interface as easily as I hoped. The trade out though in regards to everything else makes this issue extremely minor.
Research Assistant in US,"Hospital & Health Care, 10,000+ Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,User-friendly software designed to promote online businesses,Shopify is one of the most used e-commerce software that allows users to grow their online business and allows buyers like me to find a wide range of products worldwide. I have had a pleasant experience so far and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for affordable prices.,I have been using this software for quite a while and i absolutely love the design of both the mobile and computer version of the application. It is a very user friendly and easily to use and makes it possible for sellers to display a wide variety of products worldwide. One of the features that I enjoy the most is the 24 hours costumer service provided by the service. I have use it a several times and they have been able to help tremendously and at anytime. They also offer a wide variety of payments which is extremeley helpful when buying expensive items. I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a diversify market.,"Since it is an online commerce software, a lot of glitches and malfunctions happen when purchasing a product. Also, it glitches when an item is not available allowing you to make the purchase and then having to go through a refund process in order to receive your money. These are functional issues that can be improve by optimizing and developing new strategies to help the software grow exponentially."

It is the best option for the individuals who need a total arrangement, without any details connected with advancement and facilitating of the internet based store. The actual stage offers the product and facilitating that is required for sending off the site. The administrator connection point is instinctive and easy to use while the UI is convincing as well.","One more weakness of involving Shopify for your eCommerce store is that the stage's topics are altered utilizing the Shopify Liquid arrangement, which might be excessively specialized for non-experienced engineers"
Accountant in UK,"Law Practice, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,New era of shopping,"Wow, this a great place to sell your products that can be linked to all your social media platforms.","You can set up a store in one weekend because it is that easy
We can also do more with fewer clicks than with the other competitors like Magento, and Wordpress, and these do not come close in terms of ease of use.
You can create a shop section on your Facebook page from Shopify
Again on Instagram, we can tag your products in there
Pinterest is also an option if you have a business account with them","However, you could take days or weeks to set up a custom solution to fulfil your needs.
It does not come with a loyalty program, so you will need an app to implement this.
It is also not possible to embed products in blog post.
Again blog layouts are not as flexible as l would have wanted them to be."

When it comes to out of the gate music (what everybody listens/what's popular/ what was popular at some point), I struggle not to find all the things I search for.","When it comes to ""obscure"" genre, and by this I mean underrated bands or underrated artists or even underrated tv shows that you want to listen their OST, Spotify doesn't really have a lot to offer you, however they leave you the option to create your own playslists which I guess balances it out."

You can get a professional looking store just using the free templates.,"I love how easy it was to set up. It is super easy to pick a nice template and add products quickly.
The mount of external apps you can get in their Appstore, is amazing. You can get an app to do just about anything you want. Apps can handle shipping, marketing and much more.
It is simple and flexible when you connect payment processors. I have used 3 processors myself and everything is seamlessly connected and it is really simple to set up.","I owuld like better screening of the apps in the appstore, some of the apps are a bit buggy and some of them are a bit shady in their pricing structure.
But I would not let that turn me off the platform as a whole. Just be aware and do due diligence before installing apps.
Shopify Payments is their own payment processor that runs through Stripe. I think this option is too restricted. It is only available in a few countries, they are picky about which bank you use and so on."

- It is easy to install powerful marketing apps like Google, Tik Tok, and Facebook that can easily connect and use on the Shopify platform.
- It is easy to manage your entire store on that platform.","- At first, it was a bit challenging to navigate on Shopify, it could be a little more beginner-friendly because some things aren't as easy to understand and use.
- There are a lot of great features that can actually help but it is hard to know of them."

You can set up your site as simple as you like or advanced as you like...Many , many options.",So far I am still new to the software and wanted to leave a review because sometimes the first stages of using a new software can be crucial to long term or short term use. I have been provided step by step instructions on how to use the software and how to make sure I am following all of the steps of setting up an online store. I had a few hiccups along the way and they have excellent service and helpful answers to resolve problems. Setting up an online store is new to me and I have been told that this software is one of the easiest to use which is true for me. I may come back and write another review after I have used it for a few months but as a beginner it has been pretty easy.,"Since I am a beginner I do not have any cons as of yet. The only thing that really isn't a con but can seem overwhelming is that there are so many different options to how you want to set up your online store, which vendors to use and categories are endless. So it may take you a little longer than you like and it's not a bad thing to have more options than you want or need."

WordPress is way cheaper. On WordPress, you can pay for individual features, effectively getting what you want at a cheaper rate.

I already pay monthly fees and it would be great if these fees reduced. For big sellers this fees are lower than basic plan and it would be great if shopify gave 3 month trial period for small sellers.

At this point, the biggest difference is the ease of use, since the thing to be done is already designed, the application time is minimized. Since screen and vehicle customization is also among the sought after, it should be noted that it is very successful in this part as well.

The platform is incredibly intuitive and most store owners can manage the store with limited support from agencies and developers.,There's still an overall lack of liquid (Shopify's language) developers compared to other platforms and the payment processing fees add up over time if you do any significant amount of value.
CEO in US,"Cosmetics, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,Shopify is a great product for my eCommerce,It has been great. It allows my company to maximize its sales and profit. Shopify allows your company to be visible to a large group of people,It is a very intuitive application that allows for pre-made templates giving me the ability to change themes to fit the month or season.,There is not much to dislike about shopify
Communications Marketing Specialist in US,"Consumer Electronics, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,Great for what I need,"Shopify is great for starting out and for the most part, serves our needs. It's fairly simple and easy to use though could improve in some specific areas.","I use Shopify mostly for tracking, creating discount codes, and writing blogs. Surface level, it's great for all three. I think it's fairly easy to use though sometimes I feel like it can become hard to navigate.","I think there are features on the blogs that make it difficult to customize. There are often really strange formatting issues that are impossible to fix and I wish there were more options for adding in SEO and other features to your blogs. I think the system for categories for blogs is horribly hard and difficult to edit. We've had issues with Shopify integrating with our website, but I can't speak much to that as I am not in the software development field."
Manager in US,"Retail, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify is on the rise.,My experience has thus far been great its a benefit to have its easy and simple to use the features provided are helpful and it brings a shopping option an experience customers will love to use.,"Known by many customers a company on the rise, the pros would be simple and effective to use, decent prices, wide customer range and good solid companion to traditional sales options","Customer service can be better, fees can be lower, maybe more widespread recognition do ad campaign on billboards or radio TV spots etc"
freelancer in Egypt,"Computer Software, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,shopify between dreams and facts,"There is no doubt that Shopify is considered one of the leading companies in this field, but I hope to address some of the defects that I have previously mentioned above in order to occupy a higher position in the coming years.","I use Shopify throughout the previous 1 year. I have been dealing with Shopify a great deal and making distinctive online business stores for my Customers.
Robotization is powerful and mix with expansions makes ease.
Simple to arrangement everything, everything is in a hurry with practically no hustle or obstacles.
Care staff is doing incredibly well.","The fundamental disadvantage that more than shopify theme is very expensive compare with another a company.
Besides, Shopify has diverse applications which are ideal to run the store on max strength however they are a lot of exorbitant like stock"
"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,Overall I am happy with Shopify,Overall happy with Shopify and I have upgraded it as I was provided a government grant which is super helpful.,"It's quite intuitive to use and there are a lot of help articles. Also, it integrates with most apps. Shopify Experts is a great service. The reports function is super handy.","Because it's so ""done for you"", customisation can get tricky as it may impact any app plugins used. That's why I am thankful for Shopify experts. It gets expensive with all the apps with recurring payments. I believe Wordpress is cheaper over time."
"Financial Services Software, 501–1,000 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,5.0,Anybody Can Start Their Own Business at Anytime,"Overall, I love Shopify very much.","I used Shopify when I started my first business during college about a year ago. I had no knowledge of e-commerce, web-design, or business. Shopify has a lot of resources, tools, and a community that makes it easy to find answers. The support team and live chat is so helpful and quick to answer important questions. I love that Shopify makes it possible for ANYONE to start a business.","There are many apps that you can add to the store if you want other features and benefits. This is mostly a pro, but for a beginner it can be overwhelming to understand what you do or don't need for your store. The price also begins to pile up if you add a lot of apps."
Director in UK,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,The all-in-one solution,"We are sticking with Shopify now as it does everything we need, and when we move into POS sales it is a simple upgrade.",The speed at which we were able to deploy our store was very surprising. We were up & running within about two hours and if we uploaded a spreadsheet of products it would have been even quicker.,"Being able to create timed sales on products isn't a standard feature. It is possible to achieve with a plugin so it isn't a feature that's lacking, but it was a standard feature in WooCommerce."
"Consumer Goods, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,My go-to recommendation for every startup's ecommerce backend.,This is the ultimate out-of-the-box tool for every startup. Very little needed to get your store up and running quickly while having the peace of mind that it will scale with you for quite a while.,"- Very user friendly back end for non technical teammates
- Great integration support that allows you to connect to virtually any known online service that runs your business","- Certain restrictions especially on the check out cart and process are a pain; you are not able to customize them much at all
- Developing in liquid (their native coding language) can be costly as it's not well known"
Ux/Ui designer and developer in UK,"Internet, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,My first choice eCommerce system,My experience using Shopify has been nothing but brilliant over the many sites I've worked on using it.,"I like the ease of use Shopify offers. Everything from editing the page design and layout to managing products is made so easy.

Owner in US,"Arts & Crafts, Self Employed",Used the Software for: Free Trial,5.0,Top in its Class for Small to XL Businesses,"I love Shopify tools, the ease of use, and the promise they hold. At the moment, I am too small of a business to use the paid version. I look forward to scaling up and using the increasing tools and features that are available at each price tier. The whole experience is rewarding and the tech is very modern and sleek looking.","I liked that even during the trial, I was able to quickly put together a site using their templates. There were a number of professional-looking templates available, and more if I wanted to pay a little extra. I could also have the option of tweaking my site using programming languages that are simple and easy to use. I also like the pricing tiers. Since I am an extremely small business, I can actually use a LITE version for $9.00 per month, but upgrade as and when I grow. Most importantly, if you have the business, location, and budget, you can add POS systems through Shopify and they are extremely well developed and professional. One last note, Shopify has tools to ensure that your site optimizes across platforms, including mobile.","There are a few fees that I could do without, including those for using a third-party payment processor. I would like the inclusion of a custom form builder also. The last concern is that at the time I used it, photos that were dragged and dropped were not cropped with a uniform ratio."

It provides great analytics too.","We don't necessarily dislike anything yet about it, but you do have to upgrade to the next tier for more special features."
Owner in US,"Wholesale, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Excellent for easy web-hosting,I needed a platform to host my site that would be relatively cheap month-to-month. Shopify exceeds my expectations as I only spend $29 a month. I also like that you can enable 3rd-party apps to add features to your site that wouldn't be present on the template you're using.,I've started numerous sites with Shopify and it's very quick to set-up. I also like how plans start at just $29 a month.,The templates cost a lot and the free ones look subpar in my opinion. I also wish the chat feature would be a little quicker to reach an agent.
Associate in Canada,"Financial Services Software, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Nothing But The Best!,"Shopify was the first program I ever used in starting my small business. I have reviewed other software since, and this still seems to be the best platform.","Shopify is basically your go-to for anything e-commerce related. It is quick, clean and intuitive.

There has never been an easier way to create website for your brand, personal business or any other online presence.","There are multiple pros on this useful tool to create websites for either your personal website, your brand, your business or many other things involving online shopping/presence.
Another pro for this tool is the functionalities within this software allowing you to increase your presence online with different templates to choose from.","The only thing I disliked about the software is that there's multiple templates but some of them are not 100% customizable.
Sometimes the tools don't work 100%"

I've been able to manage my online business and I've already appreciated the helpful support that the Shopify team offers if I have any issues.,It's simple to use and provides a lot of automation features. It allows me to stay very organized with inventory and provides everything I need to manage my online store.,"I wish there was a feature to have prices for the online store and POS app listed differently. At the moment, it makes it difficult to update those prices if I want to change them for an in-person event/booth."

They've thought about everything!,"Shopify is helping me professionally present, market, brand and ship items for my store.","- It's everything my online store ever needed. It's refreshing to work on a platform specifically built for online stores and ease of shopping.
- From store interface for customers to maneuver effortlessly through to checkout, to shipping features, payment options, marketing tools (like selling on Instagram and Facebook), and add-on apps, Shopify has been a must for building and sustaining my online store.
- My first call to Shopify's customer service was like no other! The representative and I talked for an hour as if we were friends.

The reports are very extensive, so it's easy to see trends and performance metrics on the backend.","Shopify is user-friendly, organized, thorough, and the only CMS I would ever consider for an e-commerce company. We started using Shopify about 2 years ago and have never looked back. Every process is incredibly streamlined, and it's a clear choice if you have an e-commerce business!","Importing customers can be tedious, and I haven't found the right solution for automated email messages based on our import lists."
technical customer in Cameroon,"Telecommunications, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,shopify,for me I would say that the experience with shopify is average and icishopify can do better in terms of ergonomics and ussi to improve the management of stocks and orders on their platform,what I particularly appreciate here is the tools proposed for the creation of its site of e-commerce on which we will carry out our sales and where will be stored the products sold on our store we have access to various tools of personalizations which will allow to put forward a beautiful aspect of the store,the weak points here we have already the graphics not very interesting and also the management of stock and orders that leaves a little to be desired there is no real follow up order also the search for suppliers must improve for me I would say that shopify is more in the execution of applications that they put in place
"Wholesale, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,5.0,Love Shopify,I think the customer service is wonderful. They take care of any issues and questions in a timely manner. I like being able to have a business and explore my options.,I opened 3 stores with Shopify. The features that I love the most is being able to be creative - you can pick from a ton of themes that you buy or free ones that you can pretty much start from scratch and customize it.,I think the monthly cost (without the apps) is already a bit expensive for a business just starting out. I think once you start adding on some of the apps that are not free - it can get very costly. I wish there was a tiered approach - maybe after a year then the price increases from say $8 a month to then $15 a month and capping it.

Very easy to maneuver specially when processing orders and it notifies the customer via email automatically when order has been placed.,"Very expensive, it’s should have a threshold before Shopify start charging store owners and making sure that the owners already started making money other than start charging even if the store did not make any money yet.

Everything is managed, from the servers to the security, to the technical nitty gritty. Your job is to sell.","Everything is relatively expensive at Shopify, and there are very few plugins or apps that can work without having to buy it, unlike other competing platforms. All the apps/plugins and the theme itself may add up to be a high monthly cost for many folks to bear. If you are making money, it's not too bad.

With the monthly cost to run a store plus additional costs for some add-ons as well as transaction fees the service isn't the most cost effective, but you get what you pay for."

Also: Fantastic customer support - super nice, super helpful.","As soon as you get beyond the basics, the costs can really start adding up (and they are pretty much all recurring - so you pay for them as long as you want to keep using them). Want to be paid by paypal? that's an extra fee on top of the shopify transaction fee. Want to hook up to UPS for shipping? More money please. Want to offer volume-pricing on products (so buying 1 costs $X, but 12 costs $Y per each)? You'll need a plug-in for that, and it might not be totally compatible with your theme, and its going to cost you another fee each month. If you are setting up for a client with particular ideas in mind - not just a straight-up eCommerce store for basic items - this can drive the cost per month WAY up over the base package prices (which aren't super cheap to begin with)."

For instance, I'd like to have a base product that has attributes: length, width, flow, speed. Each model from that base product would have the same attributes with different values.

Depending on the seller's market, however, Etsy, Zazzle, or even ebay, might be a better solution for some folks.","If you've had any experience with setting up online stores, other than WooCommerce which is a different beast, you'll be right at home in Shopify's backend.
Why? Because the platform pretty much invented it.
Anyone who wants to sell products online or sell digital downloads will find it dead simple to set up a shop quickly.
The themes are surprisingly nice, too, even the free ones.
As far as power-seller features, the basic plan provides the option to send out notifications for visitors who have abandoned their carts.
This is both a thoughtful bonus but also a pretty savvy upsell strategy. Considering how effective abandoned-cart emails are in bringing customers back in, a shop on the basic plan will increase sales and therefore be ripe for an upgrade.
Win-win.","If you're making any kind of real money, you'll need to upgrade. Not sure most store owners can keep up with the fees and scale their business at the same time.
I prefer WordPress because most of my clients are asking for membership site and online courses. There are add-on apps for Shopify providing these features but they can't compete with a WordPress solution in terms of features, support, and value. IMO, of course."

"Computer Software, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,4.0,Cheap and practical to get started,Great if you need to get a solution up quickly and run a basic operation cheaply. Enterprise options are disproportionately expensive for the features they add.,Straightforward to get an e-commerce site up and running with minimal fuss and coding. Very reasonable pricing model. Easy for non-technical people to maintain.,Restrictive features for anything but the most basic/common operations. Many frequently desired features are obtained via community add-ons rather than Shopify directly. Costs for add-ons can quickly add-up.
Customer Service Specialist in US,"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Shopify is my savior,My overall review of Shopify is this truly has made selling and buying a lot easier. It's so convenient and easy to use.,"Shopify is great, All of your selling and buying needs all in one place.

Love it!!",I wish this app had a package tracker for the shop. Consumers have one however the only store app doesn't have one and it would be nice for us to know if the package has been received by the buyer.

I think for the average user it is perfectly fine, but for something as custom as what my team wanted it had its fallbacks.","I liked the back end features the most, The navigation for an admin is easy to use, and makes things easy to view at a glance.","The template customization options, we started with a template, but found it too limiting for what we wanted to achieve, and that meant using a third party app within the site, which worked okay, other than responsiveness. Felt like we were constantly running into something."

"Entertainment, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,3.0,A great start but not for the more technical,"Great if you just want a website, if you need to use their sdk's, have fun struggling for a month until you happen to stumble across a random fix.",This software allows you to setup a full website within minutes,"Once you get down to more customization they lack. Their mobile SDK's are HORRIBLE. They use GraphQL in a horrible way, do not update their sdk often, and lack good error messages. This wouldnt be a problem but their documentation lacks important errors, and other than the (pretty empty ) forums, they do not provide support for sdk issues."
Entrepreneur in France,"Arts & Crafts, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Great platform,Good experience but we need shopify payment in France,Shopify is very easy to use and the customer service is always willing to help. There is a wide variety of applications available to help us develop our business.,I don't understand why Shopify Payments is still not available in France. I keep asking but no one can tell me when. It's very unfair because we have to pay extra fees which are becoming expensive. That is truly unfair and needs to be solved ASAP
"Consumer Goods, 11–50 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,Best eComm platform out there!,Overall experience is fantastic and will continue to use the platform as well as tell others in the eComm space to use it.,"Everything about this platform is fantastic!

"Computer Software, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,Reviewer Source,5.0,Excellent platform for start up eCommerce sites,My experience with Shopify has definitely been a positive one. It was easy to get the site up and running and sales fulfillment is an easy process.,Shopify makes it very easy to fire up a new web store. I am confident that a basic store can go from an idea to a functioning Shopify store in the same day (assuming you're okay going with a prebuilt theme) and you have all of your product data ready to go. Integrations with payment processors and shipping providers is a breeze.,"As a developer, Shopify can be a learning experience because they use their own programming language. They still use conventional CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, but instead of PHP, etc., they use Liquid. It isn't complicated, it's just another language to learn."
"Machinery, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,5.0,Shopify works for us!,Shopify has worked very well for us! We are able to quickly import items and have them listed and ready to sell. Our customers really like the multiple payment options and order updates provided by Shopify. Lots of options available for apps that can change how the store operates and its abilities.,"Shopify is simple, has many options that allow you to expand your store",We would like to see Shopify support its own import system for stores like Amazon and Ebay instead of having to pay for an extra app to do this.
"Retail, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,Reviewer Source,4.0,Does Not Take a Genius to Use,"My overall experience with Shopify was pretty good. It is easy to use, good themes and reliable online platform.",One thing I liked about Simplify is that you can have minimal experience with creating a website and still get a store up and running quick with Shopify due to it is simple and easy to use to start up a business.,The least I did not like about Shopify is the cost of add-ons can add up to make it a little more costly then some of the competitors pricing.
E-commerce in India,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,The best way to start your online store.,Loved it and I will surely be back on it with a new idea very soon.,I have tried Shopify with 4 different types of stores and have enjoyed using this platform every time. It has great templates that are very easy to customise. I have experimented with various product niches to find one to stick to and it was very easy to setup and add products. It has great apps like Oberlo that i used to add products to my drop shipping store. Plus it comes with a 14 day trial. I also enjoyed the cash register sound notification that plays when a sale is made.,Nothing to hate it has all the things you need to run a drop shipping store.
President in US,"Market Research Software, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,Using Shopify,"Overall is good, not great but OK. I had to hire somebody to setup the store for me.",I like that I can sell products from almost any supplier on autopilot. It has many App integrations.,"It is kind of complicated to setup. It is not plug-and-play. Requires some technical knowledge, in my opinion."
CEO in US,"Health, Wellness & Fitness, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,3.0,Basically Wordpress but more expensive,not a fan...I ended up using a different option that is much more accommodating,I know it is a popular platform so I assume the company keeps up with the best code and ensures the best SEO result.,It is just like wordpress but you have to pay for more features...all the addons just rack up the bill. It is supposed to be for small business...those guys pinching the pennies but they do their best to drain you.
CEO in US,", 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 2+ years,5.0,Shopify is Superb,Overall Shopify is awesome! I love the Oberlo integration. Makes it easy to start any kind of store.,"I've been using Shopify for quite some time now. I really enjoy how quickly and easily I can launch an entire online store. They help you take care of every aspect of getting setup. Shopify setup simplifies: payment processing, web security with a free SSL, and they'll even help generate policies for your store.","The lack of a basic drag and drop builder really makes it tough to call Shopify an all-in-one solution. The themes they have are too ""cookie-cutter"" and third party themes always seem to have crippling issues. Your left with a cost effective platform that starts to cost a lot more if you want it to work right."
,Used the Software for: 1-5 months,Reviewer Source,4.0,"From what I can tell, Shopify is the best of its kind!",This is an excellent introduction product to the e-commerce marketplace. I was able to get a shop up and running in under a week.,"-Very easy to use. I have ZERO experience with website building, programming, etc. and I still managed quite easily. Learned a lot too!
-Very fast responses when using the online chat customer service. Although the Guru I was talking to had no programming experience either, he did what he could and booked an appointment for me with a Shopify Expert to resolve my issue. That took 1-2 days after I clarified my request.","-I find most shops are Brooklyn theme or a couple other of the basic, free templates. It takes quite a bit of customization time to be different while following the free templates. Even then, there is limited customization options of the theme without adding your own html / Java.
-I managed to find a 3 week free trial and still couldn't monetize before having to pay. I know I'm not an expert and this was my first shop, but there seems to be a big hurdle to get into the marketplace."
Owner in US,"Retail, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,Not for the most basic entrepreneur,It was a very nice software for the most part. I was just looking for something easily customizable in every way.,I like that it works very seamlessly with the available third party apps and software. There are many third party companies that have apps with Shopify. Makes Ecommerce pretty easy.,"Designing and editing your own site with custom layouts is difficult if you don't know how to code. They offer templates but the templates can only be changed by modifying the code. I've used other ecommerce platforms who feature ""drag and drop"" site building which is VERY nice for someone who wants to personalize their site without having to pay a developer every time you need a change made to your layout."
Senior Web Application Developer in US,"Information Technology & Services, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,4.0,Good for what it is,We had a problem using a custom cart for our site. This was a problem and we could not keep up with the standards and updates to manage the custom cart. Shopify fills that gap. It keeps up to date and it fulfills the needs of anyone starting an online store.,I like how easy and user friendly that it is. You can have a store setup and ready to go within 30 minutes. It has the most basic features that is needed to start you store.,The most basic features. Even though it is easy to setup and use right away. It still lacks a little more functions. Like giving distinct access to certain areas of the admin panel to specific users. It more like a all or nothing. Just wish it could break down the functions a little more.

Operations in US,"Entertainment, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,4.0,An elegant solution to ecommerce,I'm very pleased with the ability to customize and scale this software to match our needs as we expand our ecommerce presence.,"I've been selling physical and digital products on the Amazon platform for over a decade, but anytime they make a change, it impacts something on my side of the business. I needed a solution, a storefront that was easy to build, easy to scale and gave my team a sense of control. Shopify does all of that and more. It's packed with apps that highlight the possibility of growth and scale and best of all, puts all the control into our hands. We can capture email address of visitors (when shared) and then direct them to our storefront and keep them in our ecommerce ecosystem longer. I'm very pleased with how it's going.","There are a lot of options to start, so it can be fairly complicated. I wish the learning curve was a little less steep.

The ease of use for accepting payments and as well as applying themes makes this software a great tool for people starting up a clothing line.,The documentation for developers to change your website code practically does not exist.

It was very easy to learn how to use the platform, and when we were stuck support was very helpful. One pro tip I would give would be to upgrade immediately, as the support is not very helpful until you upgrade, and usually this is when you're doing all the setup and will need their help the most.","Super easy to set up and support will assist with minor customizations that might be possible within the platform. If you are on another commerce software, you'll likely see a huge savings in software costs as well as operations time. Conversions will likely improve as well because it runs very fast compared to other platforms.","While it's possible to run much more sophisticated online stores on Shopify, such as including multiple shipping fulfilment centers on order processing, custom themes etc. you will need to pay for custom work which can be pricey, and hard to project manage. This is true for any SaaS platform but should be noted that Shopify isn't going to be able to do everything turnkey."

CFO in US,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,4.0,Shopify,"I wouldn't use their software since the pricing is just too high. However, if you are making really good money then it might be worthwhile but if you're a newbie it might seem like a steep fee to pay when you're just getting started. There are plenty of other ecommerce platforms.","They have tons of add-ons that you can apply to your website. Also, they have plenty of templates that you can use to get your website started in no time.","The cost is outrageous and the fee per transaction is ridiculous. Not only is that taking money out of the businesses pocket but it's just unnecessary. Most of the apps that you can add-on to your website aren't fee and may be an additional monthly fee, so keep an eye out for that.

I decided to open my shop with amonther platform (Magento). At the same time, I regreted my choice many times. This platform is having an incedible grow over the past 10 years. It has many extensions, and cool features as integration with wordpress blogs.",This is for me the best or second best ecommerce platform if you are a small or medium merchant (maybe selling less than 300.000 usd per year). What I like most is how fast it is and that you do not need to do technical work as it is cloud based. Those are the two week points of who is probably their main competitor (Magento). I know by hard experience that those two points (lack of speed and need of constantly reparining techical issues) can kill a business. So the good performance and easiness to create an store for a non technical person makes this app a real goldnugget.,"There are some points that I do not like from the very begining. One is that they charge you a precentage of your sales, in adition to your monthly fee. And second thing is that they do not offer multi-language by default and you are foreced to use a paid extension or to open a second shop, and that can be messy for stocks. At the same time I am aware that they are developing now multilanguage feature. Also, some people say that it is not good for B2B. I have not tested that part."

Shopify gives you the ability to move into global markets easily and brings new technological advance to the platform e.g privacy, compliance, security etc, which would be a lot of work if you had to them out yourself.","The monthly subscription is not the only thing that the user will pay for.

All of our clients are happy as well.","Shopify helps you take your store online. Traditionally this meant using a website builder like Wix or WordPress. While these companies offer themes catered toward online stores, Shopify simplifies everything else related to selling stuff online, such as tracking shipments and merchandise.

I didn't expect to get everything the first time but if you are new you have to be patient. Ask the questions and keep trying with Shopify and you'll get there. The templates aren't great but they were really helpful and it got me going in the right direction. I was able to connect ebay and Facebook and many more in one day. The site keeps improving and will become more and more useful. It was not expensive to get started and as I improve so do my sales.,"When I first started it wasn't dipping my feet into the water but instead a plunge. Cons were I had to get on board at a run and the rinse and repeat was a trip fall rinse and repeat but I learned a lot at the ""free stage"" so I could decide if I wanted to take it to the next level.

Owner in US,"Apparel & Fashion, Self Employed",Used the Software for: 2+ years,3.0,Shopify is for more advanced users,I don’t know too much about it aside from a beginner’s point of view.

I plan on researching more so I can fully understand how to use the site more efficiently. Hopefully it will benefit me better after.,I liked that it was easy to start a store and find a theme that for your idea.,I don’t like that it has so many steps to get to one simple adjustment.

It is fast, convenient and very simple to use. It makes online shopping a breeze, and because it's so user friendly, many online merchants use it to sell their merchandise.","An issue that I have not experiences myself, but have heard others complain about is if you happen to make a purchase through Shopify when there is a lot of internet traffic on that site, it can freeze or shut down, making it impossible to complete the purchase. I have not heard of anyone losing money or not being able to get a refund, so I don't think that is a problem.

I felt proud to share my site with others, knowing they would have a quality experience navigating my store.",I liked that I could easily set up an ecommerce store with no experience necessary in website development. Shopify had helpful articles and clearly outlines sections that made navigating my Shopify website quite simple. I was also happy to utilize a variety of customizations and features to create an eye-catching website.,It was kind of pricey to keep up with the monthly payments. The bar to enter with a Shopify store is high and somewhat unapproachable for the new or beginner businesses from a financial standpoint.

You can connect to any kinds of apps. Like a WordPress plugin. Which can help you to sell more. They also have a big community like a youtube channel, a forum where you can discuss your problem. The community and Shopify will answer any kinds of the problem fast. Shopify also has analytics it gives you your store recent activity, your customers visited, your store speed. So you can improve your marketing efforts.",I don't find any cons. It is perfect for anyone who wants to make beautiful e-commerce.

Each transaction there is a 2 percent transaction fee that is charged to the account.

If you want your business to thrive online, it's important to work with Shopify. You won't be disappointed at the slightest.",Shopify is a great company that helps get your business seen by the public in many marketing ways. We've seen significant growth by letting them take the reigns when it comes to B2B solutions. Their Multi-Channel eCommerce is fantastic as well. It's a great way to be selling your product where your customers are already shopping.,"The only small thing is that it's a little difficult to first get started, but that's like most new things that are being implemented into business. The customer support is always willing to help, even if you are a novice."
Project Manager in Mexico,"Marketing & Advertising, 51–200 Employees",Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,A tool for e-commerce,"It is feasible to carry out marketing tactics aimed at a very well divided target audience.

It's done what I've needed it to do. I'm a graphic designer and so I like doing really custom designs and so it was difficult to not be able to do some of those things with the template since I don't know the coding language they use. If you do want to do cool custom design you can contact Shopify or someone who knows Ruby on Rails and they can help you but I didn't want to have to pay for that especially since at the time I was just testing it out as an option. There are loads of extensions that you can use (many do cost money) that really can expand the abilities and options of your online store. Shopify is heavily supported and used so it's a really good option to use for your store.,"A lot of extensions available, even though some do cost, but allow you to customize your shop and have features that don't come standard with the template or service.",Pretty difficult to do very custom styles without paying a Shopify developer to do it. Limited customizing options available on the basic templates.

Just make sure you are very aware of what you want upfront, and which apps are free or paid so you know all of your costs. Shopify is very good about laying everything out for you.","Shopify offers incredibly easy to use templates, beautiful themes, and is extremely flexible. There are a ton of apps available to help customize your storefront exactly the way you want. They are all plug and play so you don't have to do any coding with these. They also have a good amount of themes to use (Plenty more if you go with paid). Shopify also offers excellent customer service around the clock.","Shopify does charge a transaction fee, which can eat into your profits. While not a huge deal, and most of the ecommerce sites do this, it can be a little irritating. Shopify also has so many apps, and some of them are subscription based, so you will pay a monthly fee. Again, lots of little fees can add up quickly."

The themes are great too and for a managed platform they actually provide a lot of flexibility to handle things design and functionality wise. Help is fast and great and actually care.,Nothing much but it can get expensive really quickly. Need to keep an eye out.

And that there are a lot of integrations, to other programs, even if some of them are expensive.",That most of the extra Programs cost a fair amount of money and you will not get out with the amount you just paid for the shop itself. Ja can't really customize your shop unless you have mad coding skills.

But overall it's great and I love it when companies use Shopify for online purchases.",I love Shopify! It's so easy to use and I love that my information is stored for future purchases when I log in. And the verification text makes it feel secure so I can be confident that no one else can get access to my credit card information or shipping and billing information.,"For some reason the option to receive texts for shipping updates doesn't always work, and it's hard to predict when it will work and when it won't. And this includes orders from the same company and website. For example, I placed two back to back orders with the same company (forgot to add something to my shopping cart), and checked the box to receive shipping updates for both - I received updates for one order and not the other."

There are many extra apps that can be purchased to extend the functionality of the Shopify software.",Shopify relies heavily on outside software companies for apps that work with the Shopify software. I feel that some of the apps should have been included in the Shopify software itself instead of haveing to purchase apps from outside sources.

They have a very good platform which is easy to use and great support materials. I would recommend trying it.,I love how easy it was to implement the website template i like. I liked how easy it was to Intergrate with other platforms like orbelo. Very easy to add products to the website. All in all the platform is very good and easy to use.,To be honest i like pretty much everythinshopify offers in terms of making your e-commerce website look great and professional. My con was our ahopify store budgethunters.com simply did not perform to the level which we wanted considering the the advertising amounts and effort. So we unfortunately stopped using shopify and we are considering doing a custom website ourself and then integrate maybe the shopify cart or their other products.

I never had any issues and I like the fact that I can customize my website in so many different ways to make it my own.,It is easy to create a simple website and informative when needing to create a more complex site. Shopify offers a variety of templates to use both free and for a fee. It’s an easy shopping experience for your customers and provides a seamless beginning to end transaction for the seller. Shopify offers assistance in creating sites and also obtaining a domain for your shop.,I’m not too fond of the cost to maintain a website. I have found an alternative that has no monthly fee just transactional fees and that seems to fit my business needs better.

You are able to sell your product easily across multiple platforms and has a great tool to help keep inventory of what you do and don't have.,What I like least about this software is that there are many transaction fees unless the customer has some sort of Shopify payment.
Director of Marketing in US,"Media Production, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1+ year,5.0,I ALWAYS Recommend Shopify,"Besides the costly themes, this is the only site that you should use to sell anything. I've tried a bunch of the other sites, and this one is way worth the few extra dollars a month. If you can afford the upfront cost, it will be worth it in the end.","- It is SO so easy to use. Everything you need is right there in your face in their very user-friendly UX. Definitely, don't need to have any kind of coding experience to use Shopify
- Easy integrations with dropshippers
- Compared to other online selling platforms, the price is cheap considering its functionality for the cost

It offers everything you need to get your online storefront up and running quickly, and I loved the design and look of my online shop.","It would be nice to have expanded analytics and better overall support for sellers. As a long time Etsy user who is indexed by Google I found my web traffic even after ads and promotions and a lot of extra work and time to be dismal and had to close up shop. I would love to break from my Etsy shop and have my own site but at this time I am sticking with what works and what brings me money each month, and I had to stop throwing monthly payments at a service that wasn't brining in sales and created more busy work for me promoting a second platform."

The backend is super easy to navigate and if you ever have a question, you're able to reach out to their team for assistance. They also provide Shopify experts that you're able to work/collaborate with at a fee that'll help you with all your needs.","I love that Shopify provides learnings and resources as part of their package. If you're new to e-commerce, the amount of information available on the internet can be daunting, so having a dedicated resource centre provided by Shopify themselves is a great feature and the feature I love the most about it!","It's quite expensive for a startup, small business with a very small budget.

It has the functionality available to allow a business to grow, adding on features as sales and business needs increase. Their templates are amazing and cover a wide variety of interests and needs.","As someone with a technical background, it was easy to navigate, but I imagine for those without technical experience, it would be a bit harder to customize.

Shopify is really easy to use and to build a website. Adding products is super easy and you can have a pretty decent website up and running in under a day if you know what you want. Also the customer service is really great and helpful.,"You don't get a lot of features with a basic subscription and all prices are listed in USD, so if you're dealing in a currency that isn't USD you have to pay the exchange rate. This, plus most layouts don't look that great unless you pay for the more expensive ones make this product on the higher end of the price scale."

It works well for ecommerce the best in my opinion when you need a straight forward shop build. Beyond that and other platforms may be a better option.","It's easy to setup for people that have minimal website experience, and if you have done it before it's even easier. There are multiple options for themes and pricing levels for what works best for you. It's a good option for ecommerce sites starting out, and even some that are still in growing stages or medium sizes.",It becomes a little limited in accessibility without customization when you're expanding beyond just ecommerce.

The site has plenty of apps to help market your products which is a plus.,Customer service does not help with anything and when you do get them they put you back where you started off at.

Kitchen Manager in US,"Food & Beverages, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: Free Trial,4.0,My Online Store,Setting up was a breeze and although the theme is a format other stores will have its great. The cost and fees proved to be to much and waiting 8 days after everyone takes fees for a deposit didn't work for us. Designed for a bigger business with more traffic anf sales. Good idea tho.,"Could not be easier to set up a ""store"", the software basically does it for you. Using a theme from Shopify and their web branding system, my shop looks professional with a full inventory and a manager on site 24/7. It's not at all a pop up type shop and I would not be afraid to purchase an item without fear of a overseas fake site!!","The fees. After the free trial there are several monthly options and thats fine, its a business and its like a brick and morter rent. However, add card swipe fees, drop shipping fees, service gateway fees, the cost of the domains and finally payments are 7 to 8 business days to your acct. Its just a lot for a small store."

The customer requirements are varying for different customers. When we need something that can hold up on a online store, shopify is way too simple yet too robust to fill every need. Yes clients keep asking whether shopify or magento, I just say them both have their own pros. I highly recommend to go through this to be next e-commerce giant, well kidding, but sure your business will succeed, I have experienced. There are many who are competing in the market for the position shopify owns. The sleek design never fails.",Competitive pricing and sleek design for every store need makes shopify perfect choice. It is highly customisable and self hosted.,Most features fit in expect knowledge need to work around but we need to learn for perfect output.

It also has a very great customer support and people that can help you with the forums.","I disliked having to deal with currency conversions for multiple countries and multiple product listings.

There were plenty of Youtube videos to learn how to use it. My money wasn't withheld until a certain dollar amount or date.,"I do not like the pricing model and it's ultimately why I quit it. I had a couple of product launches, but then most months I did not even make enough to cover the monthly cost. I wish there had been an option to pay a percentage of my income when it was less than $40 or something.
A major issue I had was when I closed my shopify account, folks who had purchased digital products from me could no longer access them. I did not realize that the attachments on their emails would suddenly stop working and it was a big hassle for months."

,Internet,Used the Software for: 6-12 months,5.0,A Startups Best Friend for E-Commerce,I first started using Shopify for a health startup. With in-house programmers we could have used something more customized however Shopify is just so simple to use and can be up and connected in minutes. It's the only platform I advise E-Comm startups to use after they done their testing and MVP... so before getting on Shopify doing some tests with Instapage landers or other things is a first step.,Easy to use and connects into virtually everything you would need to run your business. Also they take a lot of the tech headache out of the game since they host the site and have a library of free and paid templates.,Adding on additional apps can get out of control from a overload of tools and from a cost structure since most apps are used as continuity. For larger stores doing a custom route or larger platform may be a better option. I also don't like being penalized for using Stripe since it's outside their platform... but I get it from their point of view.

Shopify has an app and theme store that allows a multitude of highly impactful customizations to be made. This helps make each Shopify store unqiue in their own way. Once a Shopify stores scales and attracts plenty of users, there are almost no reliability issues since Shopify is built to handle any kind of demand. There is no need to hire anyone to look after a Shopify store, everything is taken care of.",Each Shopify add-on application and theme costs extra money. The costs add up quickly and can be rather expensive for small businesses.

COO in,"Apparel & Fashion, 2–10 Employees",Used the Software for: 1-5 months,4.0,clothing,I've had experience utilizing shopify for my aunt's eCommerce clothing store. She has no prior knowledge on using any ecommerce software with a shopping cart so we've spent many months building a drop shipping site that did not sync with her retail shops POS system. Which was challenging because it forced us to call all the designers she currently purchases from to ask if they drop ship in the United States. It was easy to place pictures and build the store since shopify has clothing store platforms already built in. They also have a customer support staff you can email with issues but that also leads to time wasted if you cant fix the issue yourself right away.,,

The store templates are attractive (though not as much so as Squarespace commerce) and the options to integrate with a point of sale and account system are nice. There are a ton of add on apps that can broaden the features a great deal.",It wasn't long before I discovered some limits in the design and functionality of my site. My biggest pet peeve is the inability to swap out a set of different images when a different product variant (like a new colour) is selected. There are plugins one can pay for to do this but that only adds on to an already high cost for a Shopify store.
